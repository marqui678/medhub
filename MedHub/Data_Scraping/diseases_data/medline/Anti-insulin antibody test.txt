 The anti-insulin antibody test checks to see if your body has produced  antibodies  against insulin. Antibodies are proteins the body produces to protect itself when it detects anything "foreign," such as a virus or transplanted organ. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed.  How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 No special preparation is necessary. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test may be performed if: You have or are at risk for  type 1 diabetes You appear to have an allergic response to insulin Insulin no longer seems to control your diabetes Normal Results 
 
 Normally, there are no antibodies against insulin in your blood. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 If you have IgG and IgM  antibodies  against insulin, your body reacts as if the insulin in your body is a foreign protein that needs to be removed. This may make insulin less effective, or not effective at all. This is because the antibody prevents the insulin from working the right way in your cells. As a result, your blood sugar can be unusually high. The antibodies can also prolong the effect of insulin by releasing some insulin long after your meal has been absorbed. This can put you at risk for low blood sugar.  If the test shows a high level of IgE antibody against insulin, your body has developed an allergic response to the insulin. This could put you at risk for skin reactions where you inject insulin. You can also develop more severe reactions that affect your blood pressure or breathing.  Other medicines, such as antihistamines or low-dose injectable steroids, may help to lessen the reaction. If reactions have been severe, you may need a treatment process called desensitization. Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks of having blood drawn are slight but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood building up under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Alternative Names
