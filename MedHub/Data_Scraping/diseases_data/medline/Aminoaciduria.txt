 Aminoaciduria is an abnormal amount of amino acids in the urine. Amino acids are the building blocks for proteins in the body. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  clean-catch urine sample  is needed. This is often done at your doctor's office or health clinic. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Most of the time you do not need to take special steps before this test. Make sure your doctor knows all of the medicines you recently used. If this test is being done on an infant who is breast-feeding, make sure the health care provider knows what medicines the nursing mother is taking. How the Test will Feel 
 
 The test involves only normal urination. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is done to measure amino acid levels in the urine. There are many different types of amino acids. It is common for some of each kind to be found in the urine. Increased levels of individual amino acids can be a sign of a problem with metabolism. Normal Results 
 
 The specific value is measured in micromoles per deciliter (micromol/dL) or micromoles per liter (micromol/l). Alanine Children: 65 to 190 micromol/dL or 650 to 1,900 micromol/L Adults: 160 to 690 micromol/dL or 1600 to 6,900 micromol/L Alpha-aminoadipic acid Children: 25 to 78 micromol/dL or 250 to 780 micromol/L Adults: 0 to 165 micromol/dL or 0 to 1,650 micromol/L Alpha-amino-N-butyric acid Children: 7 to 25 micromol/dL or 70 to 250 micromol/L Adults: 0 to 28 micromol/dL or 0 to 280 micromol/L Arginine Children: 10 to 25 micromol/dL or 100 to 250 micromol/L Adults: 13 to 64 micromol/dL or 130 to 640 micromol/L Asparagine Children: 15 to 40 micromol/dL or 150 to 400 micromol/L Adults: 34 to 100 micromol/dL or 340 to 1,000 micromol/L Aspartic acid Children: 10 to 26 micromol/dL or 100 to 260 micromol/L Adults: 14 to 89 micromol/dL or 140 to 890 micromol/L Beta-alanine Children: 0 to 42 micromol/dL or 0 to 420 micromol/L Adults: 0 to 93 micromol/dL or 0 to 930 micromol/L Beta-amino-isobutyric acid Children: 25 to 96 micromol/dL or 250 to 960 micromol/L Adults: 10 to 235 micromol/dL or 100 to 2,350 micromol/L Carnosine Children: 34 to 220 micromol/dL or 340 to 2,200 micromol/L Adults: 16 to 125 micromol/dL or 160 to 1,250 micromol/L Citrulline Children: 0 to 13 micromol/dL or 0 to 130 micromol/L Adults: 0 to 11 micromol/dL or 0 to 110 micromol/L Cystine Children: 11 to 53 micromol/dL or 110 to 530 micromol/L Adults: 28 to 115 micromol/dL or 280 to 1,150 micromol/L Glutamic acid Children: 13 to 22 micromol/dL or 130 to 220 micromol/L Adults: 27 to 105 micromol/dL or 270 to 1,050 micromol/L Glutamine Children: 150 to 400 micromol/dL or 1,500 to 4,000 micromol/L Adults: 300 to 1,040 micromol/dL or 3,000 to 10,400 micromol/L Glycine Children: 195 to 855 micromol/dL or 1,950 to 8,550 micromol/L Adults: 750 to 2,400 micromol/dL or 7,500 to 24,000 micromol/L Histidine Children: 46 to 725 micromol/dL or 460 to 7,250 micromol/L Adults: 500 to 1500 micromol/dL or 5,000 to 15,000 micromol/L Hydroxyproline Children: not measured Adults: not measured Isoleucine Children: 3 to 15 micromol/dL or 30 to 150 micromol/L Adults: 4 to 23 micromol/dL or 40 to 230 micromol/L Leucine Children: 9 to 23 micromol/dL or 90 to 230 micromol/L Adults: 20 to 77 micromol/dL or 200 to 770 micromol/L Lysine Children: 19 to 140 micromol/dL or 190 to 1,400 micromol/L Adults: 32 to 290 micromol/dL or 320 to 2,900 micromol/L Methionine Children: 7 to 20 micromol/dL or 70 to 200 micromol/L Adults: 5 to 30 micromol/dL or 50 to 300 micromol/L 1-methylhistidine Children: 41 to 300 micromol/dL or 410 to 3,000 micromol/L Adults: 68 to 855 micromol/dL or 680 to 8,550 micromol/L 3-methylhistidine Children: 42 to 135 micromol/dL or 420 to 1,350 micromol/L Adults: 64 to 320 micromol/dL or 640 to 3,200 micromol/L Ornithine Children: 3 to 16 micromol/dL or 30 to 160 micromol/L Adults: 5 to 70 micromol/dL or 50 to 700 micromol/L Phenylalanine Children: 20 to 61 micromol/dL or 200 to 610 micromol/L Adults: 36 to 90 micromol/dL or 360 to 900 micromol/L Phosphoserine Children: 16 to 34 micromol/dL or 160 to 340 micromol/L Adults: 28 to 95 micromol/dL or 280 to 950 micromol/L Phosphoethanolamine Children: 24 to 66 micromol/dL or 240 to 660 micromol/L Adults: 17 to 95 micromol/dL or 170 to 950 micromol/L Proline Children: not measured Adults: not measured Serine Children: 93 to 210 micromol/dL or 930 to 2,100 micromol/L Adults: 200 to 695 micromol/dL or 2,000 to 6,950 micromol/L Taurine Children: 62 to 970 micromol/dL or 620 to 9,700 micromol/L Adults: 267 to 1290 micromol/dL or 2,670 to 12,900 micromol/L Threonine Children: 25 to 100 micromol/dL or 250 to 1,000 micromol/L Adults: 80 to 320 micromol/dL or 800 to 3,200 micromol/L Tyrosine Children: 30 to 83 micromol/dL or 300 to 830 micromol/L Adults: 38 to 145 micromol/dL or 380 1,450 micromol/L Valine Children: 17 to 37 micromol/dL or 170 to 370 micromol/L Adults: 19 to 74 micromol/dL or 190 to 740 micromol/ Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results. The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Increased total urine amino acids may be due to: Alkaptonuria Canavan disease Cystinosis Cystathioninuria Fructose intolerance Galactosemia Hartnup disease Homocystinuria Hyperammonemia Hyperparathyroidism Maple syrup urine disease Methylmalonic acidemia Multiple myeloma Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency Osteomalacia Propionic acidemia Rickets Tyrosinemia type 1 Tyrosinemia type 2 Viral  hepatitis Wilson disease Considerations 
 
 Screening infants for increased levels of amino acids can help detect problems with metabolism. Early treatment for these conditions may prevent complications in the future. Alternative Names
