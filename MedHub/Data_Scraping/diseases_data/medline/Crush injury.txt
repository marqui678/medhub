  A crush injury occurs when force or pressure is put on a body part. This type of injury most often happens when part of the body is squeezed between 2 heavy objects. Damage related to crush injuries include: Bleeding Bruising Compartment syndrome  (increased pressure in an arm or leg that causes serious muscle, nerve, blood vessel, and tissue damage) Fracture Laceration  (open wound) Nerve injury Secondary infection Smashed fingers Wounds First Aid 
 
 Steps for first aid treatment of a crush injury are: Stop bleeding by applying direct pressure. Cover the area with a wet cloth or bandage. Then, raise the area above the level of the heart, if possible. If there is suspicion of a head, neck or spinal injury, immobilize those areas if possible and then limit movement to only the crushed area. Call your local emergency number (such as 911) or local hospital for further advice.  Crush injuries most often need to be evaluated in a hospital emergency department. Surgery may be needed.
