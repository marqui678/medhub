 The Ham test is a blood test to diagnose  paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  (PNH). This rare condition causes red blood cells to die before they should. The Ham test checks whether red blood cells become more fragile when they are placed in mild acid. Today, the Ham test is being replaced by a test called flow cytometry. Alternative Names
