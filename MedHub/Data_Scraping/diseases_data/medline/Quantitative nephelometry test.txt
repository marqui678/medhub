 Quantitative nephelometry is a lab test to quickly and accurately measure levels of certain proteins called immunoglobulins in the blood. Immunoglobulins are  antibodies  that help fight infection. This test specifically measures the immunoglobulins IgM, IgG, and IgA. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample is needed . How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 You may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 hours before the test. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 The test provides a rapid and accurate measurement of the amounts of the immunoglobulins IgM, IgG, and IgA. Normal Results 
 
 Normal results for the 3 immunoglobulins are: IgG: 560 to 1800 mg/dL IgM: 45 to 250 mg/dL IgA: 100 to 400 mg/dL  The examples above show the common measurements for these test results. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 An increased level of IgG may be due to: Chronic  infection or inflammation Hyperimmunization  (higher than normal number of specific antibodies) IgG  multiple myeloma  (a type of blood cancer) Liver disease Rheumatoid arthritis Decreased levels of IgG may be due to: Agammaglobulinemia  (very low levels of immunoglobulins, a very rare disorder) Leukemia  (blood cancer) Multiple myeloma  (bone marrow cancer) Preeclampsia  (high blood pressure during pregnancy) Treatment with certain chemotherapy drugs  Increased levels of IgM may be due to: Mononucleosis Lymphoma (cancer of the lymph tissue) Waldenström macroglobulinemia  (cancer of the white blood cells) Multiple myeloma Rheumatoid arthritis  Decreased levels of IgM may be due to: Agammaglobulinemia (very rare) Leukemia Multiple myeloma  Increased levels of IgA may be due to: Chronic infections, especially of the gastrointestinal tract Inflammatory bowel disease, such as  Crohn disease Multiple myeloma  Decreased levels of IgA may be due to: Agammaglobulinemia (very rare) Hereditary IgA deficiency Multiple myeloma Gut disease that leads to protein loss Other tests are needed to confirm or diagnose any of the conditions above. Risks 
 
 There is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Alternative Names
