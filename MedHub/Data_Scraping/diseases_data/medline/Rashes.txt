 Rashes involve changes in the color or texture of your skin. Considerations 
 
 Often, the cause of a rash can be determined from its visible characteristics and other symptoms. Causes 
 
 A simple rash is called dermatitis, meaning inflammation of the skin.  Contact dermatitis  is caused by things your skin touches, such as: Chemicals in elastic, latex, and rubber products Cosmetics, soaps, and detergents Dyes and other chemicals in clothing Poison ivy, oak, or sumac Seborrheic dermatitis  is a rash that appears in patches of redness and scaling around the eyebrows, eyelids, mouth, nose, trunk, and behind the ears. If it happens on your scalp, it is called dandruff in adults and cradle cap in infants. Age, stress, fatigue, weather extremes, oily skin, infrequent shampooing, and alcohol-based lotions aggravate this harmless but bothersome condition. Other common causes of a rash include: Eczema  (atopic dermatitis) -- tends to happen in people with allergies or asthma. The rash is generally red, itchy, and scaly. Psoriasis  -- tends to occur as red, scaly, itchy patches over joints and along the scalp. Fingernails may also be affected. Impetigo  -- common in children, this infection is from bacteria that live in the top layers of the skin. It appears as red sores that turn into blisters, ooze, then crust over. Shingles  -- a painful blistered skin condition caused by the same virus as chickenpox. The virus can lie dormant in your body for many years and re-emerge as shingles. Childhood illnesses such as  chickenpox ,  measles ,  roseola ,  rubella ,  hand-foot-mouth disease ,  fifth disease , and  scarlet fever Medications and  insect bites or stings Many medical conditions can cause a rash as well. These include: Lupus erythematosus Rheumatoid arthritis , especially the  juvenile type Kawasaki disease Home Care 
 
 Most simple rashes will improve with gentle skin care and by avoiding irritating substances. Follow these general guidelines: Avoid scrubbing your skin. Use as little soap as possible. Use gentle cleansers instead. Avoid applying cosmetic lotions or ointments directly on the rash. Use warm (not hot) water for cleaning. Pat dry, don't rub. Stop using any recently added cosmetics or lotions. Leave the affected area exposed to the air as much as possible. Try calamine medicated lotion for poison ivy, oak, or sumac, as well as for other types of contact dermatitis.  Hydrocortisone cream (1%) is available without a prescription and may soothe many rashes. If you have  eczema , apply moisturizers over your skin. Try oatmeal bath products, available at drugstores, to relieve symptoms of eczema, psoriasis, or shingles. When to Contact a Medical Professional

Have you had any change in your medications? Have you noticed a tick or insect bite? Have you eaten anything unusual? Do you have any other symptoms, like itching or scaling?
