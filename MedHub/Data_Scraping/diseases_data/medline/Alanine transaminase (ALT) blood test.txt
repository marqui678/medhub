 The alanine transaminase (ALT) blood test measures the level of the  enzyme  ALT in the blood. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed.  How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 No special preparation is needed. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 ALT is an enzyme found in a high level in the liver. Injury to the liver results in release of ALT into the blood. This test is used to determine if a person has liver damage. Normal Results 
 
 The normal range is: Male: 10 to 40 U/L Female: 7 to 35 U/L  Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 An increased ALT level is usually a sign of liver disease. Liver disease is even more likely when the levels of substances checked by other  liver blood tests  have also increased. An increased ALT level may be due to any of the following: Scarring of the liver ( cirrhosis ) Death of liver tissue  Swollen and inflamed liver ( hepatitis ) Too much iron in the body ( hemochromatosis ) Too much fat in the liver (fatty liver) Lack of blood flow to the liver (liver ischemia) Liver tumor or cancer Use of drugs that are toxic to the liver Mononucleosis  ("mono") Swollen and inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis) Risks 
 
 There is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Bleeding from where the needle was inserted Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood collecting under the skin) Infection (rare)  Alternative Names
