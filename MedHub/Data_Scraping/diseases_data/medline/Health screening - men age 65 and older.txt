 You should visit your health care provider regularly, even if you feel healthy. The purpose of these visits is to: Screen for medical issues Assess your risk for future medical problems Encourage a healthy lifestyle Update vaccinations Help you get to know your provider in case of an illness  Information 
 
 Even if you feel fine, you should still see your provider for regular checkups. These visits can help you avoid problems in the future. For example, the only way to find out if you have  high blood pressure  is to have it checked regularly. High blood sugar and  high cholesterol  levels also may not have any symptoms in the early stages. A simple blood test can check for these conditions. There are specific times when you should see your provider. Below are screening guidelines for men age 65 and older.  ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM SCREENING If you are between ages 65 and 75 and have smoked, you should have an ultrasound to screen for  abdominal aortic aneurysms . Other men should discuss this screening with their provider.  BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENING Have your blood pressure checked every year. If the top number (systolic number) is between 120 and 139 or the bottom number (diastolic number) is between 80 and 89 mm Hg or higher, then continue to have it checked every year. If you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, you may need to be checked more often, at least once a year. Watch for blood pressure screenings in your area. Ask your provider if you can stop in to have your blood pressure checked. You can also check your blood pressure using the automated machines at local grocery stores and pharmacies. If the top number is greater than 140, or the bottom number is greater than 90, schedule an appointment with your provider. CHOLESTEROL SCREENING AND HEART DISEASE PREVENTION Your cholesterol should be checked at least every 5 years if levels are normal. If you have high cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, you may need to be checked more often.  LUNG CANCER SCREENING The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in adults until age 80 who: Have a 30 pack-year smoking history AND Currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years  COLON CANCER SCREENING Until age 75, you should have one of the following screening tests: A fecal occult blood test done every year Flexible  sigmoidoscopy  every 5 years, along with a fecal occult blood test Colonoscopy every 10 years  You may need a colonoscopy more often if you have risk factors for colon cancer, such as: Ulcerative colitis A personal or family history of cancer of the colon or rectum A history of large growths called adenomas  
DIABETES SCREENING
 If you are age 65 or older and in good health, you should be screened for diabetes every 3 years. If you are overweight and have other risk factors for diabetes, ask your provider if you should be screened more often.  
DENTAL EXAM
 Go to the dentist once or twice every year for an exam and cleaning. Your dentist will evaluate if you have a need for more frequent visits.  
EYE EXAM
 Have an eye exam every 1 to 2 years.  Have an eye exam at least every year if you have diabetes. 
HEARING TEST
 Have your hearing tested if you have symptoms of hearing loss.  
IMMUNIZATIONS
 If you are age 65 or older, get a pneumococcal vaccine if you have never had one, or if it has been more than 5 years since you had the vaccine. You should get a  flu  shot each year. Get a tetanus-diphtheria booster every 10 years. You may get a shingles or herpes zoster vaccine after age 60.  
OSTEOPOROSIS SCREENING
 If you have risk factors for  osteoporosis , you should check with your provider about screening. Risk factors can include long-term steroid use, low body weight, smoking, heavy alcohol use, a fracture after age 50, or a family history of osteoporosis. Men age 70 and over should consider getting bone mineral density testing.  
PROSTATE CANCER SCREENING
 Talk with your provider about  prostate cancer  screening. The potential benefits of  PSA testing  as a routine screening test have not been shown to outweigh the harms of testing and treatment. Prostate examinations are no longer routinely done on men with no symptoms.  
PHYSICAL EXAMS
 Have a yearly physical exam. Your provider will check your weight, height, and body mass index (BMI).  During the exam, your provider will ask you questions about: Your medicines and risk for interactions Alcohol and tobacco use Diet and exercise Safety, such as using a seat belt, or smoke alarms Depression  Alternative Names
