 The  lactate dehydrogenase  (LDH) isoenzyme test checks how much of the different types of LDH are in the blood. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 The health care provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking certain medicines before the test. Drugs that can increase LDH measurements include: Anesthetics Aspirin Clofibrate Fluorides Mithramycin Narcotics Procainamide  DO NOT stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel slight pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is usually done when your doctor thinks you might have high LDH levels. Measurement of LDH isoenzymes helps determine the location of any tissue damage. LDH is found in many body tissues such as the heart, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, brain, blood cells, and lungs. LDH exists in five forms, which differ slightly in structure. LDH-1 is found primarily in heart muscle and red blood cells. LDH-2 is concentrated in white blood cells. LDH-3 is highest in the lung. LDH-4 is highest in the kidney, placenta, and pancreas. LDH-5 is highest in the liver and skeletal muscle.  All of these can be measured in the blood. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 LDH levels that are higher than normal may suggest: Hemolytic anemia Hypotension Infectious mononucleosis Intestinal ischemia (blood deficiency) and infarction (tissue death) Ischemic cardiomyopathy Liver disease such as  hepatitis Lung tissue death Muscle injury Muscular dystrophy Pancreatitis Lung tissue death Stroke Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Drawing blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Alternative Names
