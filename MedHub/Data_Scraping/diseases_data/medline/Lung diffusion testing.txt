 Lung diffusion testing measures how well the lungs exchange gases. This is an important part of  lung testing , because the major function of the lungs is to allow oxygen to "diffuse" or pass into the blood from the lungs, and to allow carbon dioxide to "diffuse" from the blood into the lungs. How the Test is Performed 
 
 You breathe in (inhale) air containing a very small amount of  carbon monoxide  and a tracer gas, such as methane or helium. You hold your breath for 10 seconds, then rapidly blow it out (exhale). The exhaled gas is tested to determine how much of the tracer gas was absorbed during the breath. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Before taking this test: Do not eat a heavy meal before the test. Do not smoke for at least 4 to 6 hours before the test.  If you use a bronchodilator or other inhaled medicines, ask your health care provider whether or not you can use them before the test. How the Test will Feel 
 
 The mouthpiece fits tightly around your mouth. Clips are put on your nose.  Why the Test is Performed 
 
 The test is used to diagnose certain lung diseases, and to monitor the status of people with established lung disease. Repeatedly measuring the diffusing capacity can help determine whether the disease is improving or getting worse. Normal Results 
 
 Normal test results depend on a person's: Age Gender Height Hemoglobin (the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen) level What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Abnormal results mean that gases do not move normally across the lung tissues into the blood vessels of the lung. This may be due to lung diseases such as: Emphysema Interstitial fibrosis Pulmonary embolism Pulmonary hypertension Sarcoidosis Lung hemorrhage Asthma Risks 
 
 There are no significant risks. Considerations 
 
 Other  pulmonary function tests  may be done together with this test. Alternative Names
