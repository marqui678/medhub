 Laser therapy is a medical treatment that uses a strong beam of light to cut, burn, or destroy tissue. The term LASER stands for "Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation." Information 
 
 The laser light beam does not pose health risks to the patient or medical team. Laser treatment has the same risks as open surgery, including pain, bleeding, and scarring. But recovery time from laser surgery is usually faster than recovery from open surgery. Lasers can be used for many medical purposes. Because the laser beam is so small and precise, it allows health care providers to safely treat tissue without injuring the surrounding area. Lasers are often used to: Treat varicose veins Improve vision during  eye surgery on the cornea Repair a detached retina of the eye Remove the prostate Remove kidney stones Remove  tumors Lasers are also often used during  skin surgery .
