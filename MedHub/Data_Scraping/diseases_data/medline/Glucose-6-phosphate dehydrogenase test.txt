 Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a protein that helps red blood cells work properly. The G6PD test looks at the amount (activity) of this substance in red blood cells. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 No special preparation is usually necessary. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 Your health care provider may recommend this test if you have signs of  G6PD deficiency . This means you do not have enough G6PD activity. Too little G6PD activity leads to the destruction of red blood cells. This process is called  hemolysis . When this process is actively occurring, it is called a hemolytic episode. Hemolytic episodes can be triggered by infections, severe stress, certain foods (such as fava beans), and certain medicines, including: Antipyretics (drugs used to reduce fever) Nitrofurantoin Phenacetin Primaquine Sulfonamides Thiazide diuretics Tolbutamide Quinidine  Normal Results 
 
 


Normal values vary and depend upon the laboratory used. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. 


 
 What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Abnormal results mean you have a G6PD deficiency. This can cause  hemolytic anemia  in certain conditions. Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Alternative Names
