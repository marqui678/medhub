 The ACE test measures the level of angiotensin-converting  enzyme  (ACE) in the blood. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample is needed . How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Follow your health care provider's instructions for not eating or drinking for up to 12 hours before the test. If you are on steroid medicine, ask your provider if you need to stop the medicine before the test, because steroids can decrease ACE levels. DO NOT stop any medicine before talking to your provider. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test may be commonly ordered to help diagnose and monitor a disorder called  sarcoidosis . People with sarcoidosis may have their ACE level tested regularly to check how severe the disease is and how well treatment is working.  This test also helps confirm  Gaucher disease  and  leprosy . Normal Results 
 
 Normal values vary based on your age and the test method used. Adults have an ACE level less than 40 micrograms/L. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Higher than normal ACE level may be a sign of sarcoidosis. ACE levels may rise or fall as sarcoidosis worsens or improves. A higher than normal ACE level may also be seen in several other diseases and disorders, including: Cancer of the lymph tissue ( Hodgkin disease ) Diabetes Liver swelling and inflammation ( hepatitis ) due to alcohol use Lung disease such as  asthma , cancer,  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , or  tuberculosis Kidney disorder called  nephrotic syndrome Multiple sclerosis Overactive thyroid ( hyperthyroidism )  Lower than normal ACE level may indicate: Chronic liver disease Eating disorder called  anorexia nervosa Steroid therapy (usually prednisone) Therapy for sarcoidosis Underactive thyroid ( hypothyroidism )  Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. The risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Alternative Names
