 The ammonia test measures the level of ammonia in a blood sample. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed.  How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Your health care provider may ask you to stop taking certain drugs that may affect test results. These include: Alcohol Acetazolomide Narcotics Valproic acid  You should not smoke before your blood is drawn. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 Ammonia (NH3) is produced by cells throughout the body, especially the intestines, liver, and kidneys. Most of the ammonia produced in the body is used by the liver to produce urea. Urea is also a waste product, but it is much less toxic than ammonia. Ammonia is especially toxic to the brain. It can cause confusion,  lethargy , and sometimes coma. This test may be done if you have, or your provider thinks you have, a condition that may cause a toxic buildup of ammonia. It is most commonly used to diagnose and monitor  hepatic encephalopathy , a severe liver disease. Normal Results 
 
 The normal range is 15 to 45 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL)Â or 10.71 to 32.13 micromoles per liter (micromol/L). Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Abnormal results may mean you have increased ammonia levels in your blood. This may be due to any of the following: Heart failure Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding , usually in the upper GI tract Genetic diseases of the urea cycle High body temperature (hyperthermia) Leukemia Liver failure Low blood potassium level Severe muscle exertion  A high-protein diet can also raise the blood ammonia level. Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Alternative Names
