 The FTA-ABS test is a blood test to detect antibodies to the bacteria  Treponema pallidum,  which causes syphilis. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample is needed . How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 No special preparation is necessary. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is done routinely to confirm whether a positive screening test for syphilis (either  VDRL  or  RPR ) means you have a current syphilis infection. It may also be done when other syphilis tests are negative, to rule out a possible false-negative result. Normal Results 
 
 A negative or nonreactive result means that you do not have a current or past infection with syphilis. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 A positive FTA-ABS is often a sign of a syphilis infection. This test result will remain positive for life even if syphilis has been adequately treated. Therefore, it cannot be used to monitor the treatment of syphilis or determine that you have active syphilis. Other illnesses, such as  yaws  and pinta (2 other kinds of skin diseases), may also result in positive FTA-ABS results. Sometimes, there can be a false-positive result, most often in women with  lupus . Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names
