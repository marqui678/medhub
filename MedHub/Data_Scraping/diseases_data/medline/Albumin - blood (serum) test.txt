        		Albumin is a protein made by the liver. A serum albumin test measures the amount of this protein in the clear liquid portion of the blood. Albumin can also be measured in the  urine . 
 
 
 
 
 
 How the Test is Performed 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The health care provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking certain medicines that can affect the test. Drugs that can increase albumin levels include: 
 
 Anabolic steroids  
 Androgens 
 Growth hormone 
 Insulin 
 
 Do not stop taking any of your medicines without talking to your provider first.

 How the Test will Feel 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Why the Test is Performed 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Albumin helps move many small molecules through the blood, including  bilirubin , calcium, progesterone, and medicines. It plays an important role in keeping the fluid from the blood from leaking out into the tissues. This test can help determine if a patient has  liver disease  or kidney disease, or if the body is not absorbing enough  protein . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Normal Results 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The normal range is 3.4 to 5.4 g/dL. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A lower-than-normal level of blood albumin may be a sign of: 
 
 Kidney diseases 
 Liver disease (for example,  hepatitis , or  cirrhosis  that may cause  ascites ) 
 
 Decreased blood albumin may occur when your body does not get or absorb enough nutrients, such as with: 
 
 After weight-loss surgery 
 Crohn disease 
 Low-protein diets Celiac disease 
 Whipple disease 
 
 Increased blood albumin may be due to: 
 
 Dehydration 
 High protein diet 
 Having a tourniquet on for a long time when giving a blood sample 
 
 Other conditions for which the test may be performed: 
 
 Burns (widespread) 
 Wilson disease 
 
 If you are receiving large amounts of intravenous fluids, the result of this test may be inaccurate. Albumin will be decreased during pregnancy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Risks 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 There is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: 
 
 Bleeding from where the needle was inserted 
 Fainting or feeling lightheaded 
 Hematoma (blood collecting under the skin) 
 Infection (rare)
