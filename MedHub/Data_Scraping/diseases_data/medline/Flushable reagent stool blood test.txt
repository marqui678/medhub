 Flushable reagent stool blood test is an at-home test to detect hidden blood in the stool. How the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is performed at home with disposable pads. You can buy the pads at the drug store without a prescription. Brand names include EZ-Detect, HomeChek Reveal, and ColoCARE. You do not handle stool directly with this test. You simply note any changes you see on a card and then mail the results card to your health care provider. To do the test: Urinate if you need to, then flush the toilet before having a bowel movement. After the bowel movement, place the disposable pad in the toilet. Watch for a change of color on the test area of the pad. Results will appear in about 2 minutes. Note the results on the card provided, then flush the pad away. Repeat for the next two bowel movements.  The different tests use different ways to check for water quality. Check the package for instructions. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Some medicines may interfere with this test. Check with your provider about changes in your medicines you may need to make. Never stop taking a medicine or change how you take it without first talking to your provider. Check test package to see if there are any foods you need to stop eating before doing the test. How the Test will Feel 
 
 This test involves only normal bowel functions, and there is no discomfort. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is mainly performed for colorectal cancer screening. It may also be done in the case of low levels of red blood cells (anemia). Normal Results 
 
 A negative result is normal. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Talk to your provider about your test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Abnormal results of the flushable pad mean there is bleeding present somewhere in the digestive tract, which may be caused by: Swollen, fragile blood vessels in the colon that may result in blood loss  Colon cancer  Colon polyps  Enlarged veins, called varices, in the walls of the esophagus (the tube that connects your throat to your stomach) that bleed  When the lining of the stomach or the esophagus becomes inflamed or swollen  Infections in the stomach and intestines  Hemorrhoids  Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis  Ulcer in the stomach or first part of the intestines  Other causes of a positive test, which do not indicate a problem in the gastrointestinal tract, include: Coughing up and then swallowing blood  Nose bleed Abnormal test results require follow-up with your doctor. Risks 
 
 The test can have false-positive (the test indicates a problem when there actually is none) or false-negative (the test indicates there is NOT a problem, but there is) results. This is similar to other stool smear tests which can also give false results. Alternative Names
