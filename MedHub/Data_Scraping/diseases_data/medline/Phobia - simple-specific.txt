 A phobia is an ongoing intense fear or anxiety of a certain object, animal, activity, or setting that poses little to no actual danger. Causes 
 
 Specific phobias are a type of anxiety disorder in which a person may feel extremely anxious or has a panic attack when exposed to the object of fear. Specific phobias are a common mental disorder. Common phobias include the fear of: Being in places where it is hard to escape, such as crowds, bridges, or of being outside alone Blood, injections, and other medical procedures Certain animals (for instance, dogs or snakes) Enclosed spaces Flying High places Insects or spiders Lightning  Symptoms 
 
 Being exposed to the feared object, or even thinking about being exposed to it causes an  anxiety  reaction. This fear or anxiety is much stronger than the real threat. You may sweat excessively, have problems controlling your muscles or actions, or have a fast heart rate.  You avoid settings in which you may come into contact with the feared object or animal. For example, you may avoid driving through tunnels, if tunnels are your phobia. This type of avoidance can interfere with your job and social life. Exams and Tests
