 Treatment hasÂ two parts. The first goal is to make sure the child is in a safe environment where emotional and physical needs are met. Once that has been established, the next step is to change the relationship between the caregiver and the child, if the caregiver is the problem. Parenting classes can help the caregiver meet the child's needs and bond with the child. Counseling may help the caregiver work on problems, such as drug abuse or family violence. Social Services should follow the family to make sure the child remains in a safe, stable environment. Outlook (Prognosis) 
 
 The right intervention can improve the outcome. Possible Complications 
 
 If not treated, this condition can permanently affect the child's ability to interact with others. It can be connected with: Anxiety Depression Other psychological problems Post-traumatic stress disorder When to Contact a Medical Professional 
 
 This disorder is usually identified when a parent (or prospective parent) is at high risk for neglect or when an adoptive parent has difficulty coping with a newly adopted child. If you have recently adopted a child from a foreign orphanage or another situation where neglect may have occurred and your child shows these symptoms, see your health care provider. Prevention 
 
 Early recognition is very important for the child. Parents who are at high risk for neglect should be taught parenting skills. The family should be followed by either a social worker or doctor to make sure the child's needs are being met. References
