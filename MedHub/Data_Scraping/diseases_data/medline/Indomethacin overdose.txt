 Have this information ready: Person's age, weight, and condition Name of the product (and strength, if known) Time it was swallowed Amount swallowed If the medicine was prescribed for the person Poison Control 
 
 Your  local poison center  can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room 
 
 Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible. The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. The person may receive: Activated charcoal Blood and urine tests Breathing support, including a tube through the mouth and a breathing machine (ventilator) EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) Fluids through a vein (by IV) Laxative Medicines to reverse stomach inflammation and bleeding, breathing problems, and other symptoms Tube through the mouth into the stomach to empty the stomach ( gastric lavage )  Outlook (Prognosis) 
 
 How well someone does depends on how much indomethacin they swallowed and how quickly they receive treatment. The faster the person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery. A mild overdose of this medicine does not usually cause serious problems. The person may have some stomach pain and vomiting (possibly with blood). However, a large amount of internal bleeding is possible, and a blood transfusion may be needed. Passing a tube with a camera through the mouth into the stomach may be needed to stop the internal bleeding. A large overdose can be very harmful to children and adults. Death may occur.
