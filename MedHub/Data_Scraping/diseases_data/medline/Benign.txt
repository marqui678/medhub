 "Benign" refers to a condition,  tumor , or growth that is not cancerous. This means that it does not spread to other parts of the body. It does not invade nearby tissue. Sometimes, a condition is called benign to suggest it is not dangerous or serious.  In general, a benign tumor grows slowly and is not harmful. However, this is not always the case. A benign tumor may grow big enough or be found near blood vessels, the brain, nerves, or organs. As a result, it can cause problems without spreading to another part of the body. Sometimes, these problems can be serious. The opposite of benign is  malignant . Images
