 Methylmalonic acid is a substance produced when proteins, called amino acids, in the body break down. The health care provider may order this test if there are signs of certain genetic disorders, such as  methylmalonic acidemia . Testing for this disorder is often done as part of a  newborn screening exam . This test may also be done with other tests to check for a  vitamin B12 deficiency . Normal Results 
 
 Normal values are 0.08 to 0.56 micromoles per liter. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 A higher than normal value may be due to vitamin B12 deficiency or methylmalonic acidemia. Risks

Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Images
