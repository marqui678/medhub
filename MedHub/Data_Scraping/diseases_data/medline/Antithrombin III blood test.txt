 Antithrombin III (AT III) is a protein that helps control blood clotting. A blood test can determine the amount of AT III present in your body.  How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample is needed . How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Certain medicines may affect the results of the test. Your health care provider may tell you to stop taking certain medicines or reduce their dose before the test. Do not stop taking any medicine before speaking with your doctor. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 Your provider may order this test if you have repeated  blood clots  or if blood thinning medicine does not work. Normal Results 
 
 Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Lower-than-normal AT III may mean you have an increased risk of blood clotting. This can occur when there is not enough AT III in your blood, or when there is enough AT III in your blood, but the AT III does not function properly and is less active.  Abnormal results may not show up until you are an adult. Examples of complications associated with increased blood clotting are: Deep venous thrombosis Phlebitis  (vein inflammation) Pulmonary embolus  (blood clot traveling to lung) Thrombophlebitis (vein inflammation with clot formation)  Lower than normal AT III may be due to: Bone marrow transplant Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) AT III deficiency, an inherited condition Liver cirrhosis Nephrotic syndrome  Higher than normal AT III may be due to: Use of anabolic steroids  Bleeding disorder ( hemophilia ) Kidney transplant Low level of vitamin K Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names
