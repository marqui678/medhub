 Urinalysis is the physical, chemical, and microscopic examination of urine. It involves a number of tests to detect and measure various compounds that pass through the urine. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A urine sample is needed. Your health care provider will tell you what type of urine sample is needed. Two common methods of collecting urine are  24-hour urine collection  and  clean catch urine specimen .  The sample is sent to a lab, where it is examined for the following: PHYSICAL COLOR AND APPEARANCE How the urine sample looks to the naked eye: Is it clear or cloudy? Is it is pale, or dark yellow, or another color?  MICROSCOPIC APPEARANCE The urine sample is examined under a microscope to: Check if there are any cells, urine crystals,  urinary casts , mucus, and other substances. Identify any bacteria or other germs.  CHEMICAL APPEARANCE ( urine chemistry ) A special strip (dipstick) is used to test for substances in the urine sample. The strip has pads of chemicals that change color when they come in contact with substances of interest.  Examples of specific urinalysis tests that may done to check for problems include: Red blood cell urine test Glucose urine test Protein urine test Urine pH urine test Ketones urine test Bilirubin urine test Urine specific gravity test How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Certain medicines change the color of urine, but this is not a sign of disease. Your provider may tell you to stop taking any medicines that can affect test results. Medicines that can change your urine color include: Chloroquine Iron supplements Levodopa Nitrofurantoin Phenazopyridine Phenothiazine Phenytoin Riboflavin Triamterene  How the Test will Feel 
 
 The test involves only normal urination, and there is no discomfort. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 A urinalysis may be done: As part of a routine medical exam to screen for early signs of disease If you have signs of  diabetes  or kidney disease, or to monitor you if you are being treated for these conditions To check for  blood in the urine To diagnose a  urinary tract infection Normal Results 
 
 Normal urine varies in color from almost colorless to dark yellow. Some foods, such as beets and blackberries, may turn urine red. Usually, glucose, ketones, protein, and bilirubin are not detectable in urine. The following are not normally found in urine: Hemoglobin Nitrites Red blood cells White blood cells  Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Abnormal results may mean you have an illness, such as: Urinary tract infection Kidney stones Poorly controlled diabetes Bladder  or  kidney cancer Your provider can discuss the results with you. Risks 
 
 There are no risks. Considerations 
 
 If a home test is used, the person reading the results must be able to see the difference between colors, because the results are interpreted using a color chart. Alternative Names
