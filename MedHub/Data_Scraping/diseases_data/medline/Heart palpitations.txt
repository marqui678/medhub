          			Palpitations are feelings or sensations that your heart is pounding or racing. They can be felt in your chest, throat, or neck. You may: 
 
 Have an unpleasant awareness of your own heartbeat 
 Feel like your heart skipped or stopped beats 
 
 The heart's rhythm may be normal or abnormal when you have palpitations. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Considerations 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Normally the heart beats 60 to 100 times per minute. The rate may drop below 60 beats per minute in people who exercise routinely or take medicines that slow the heart. If your heart rate is fast (over 100 beats per minute), this is called tachycardia. A heart rate slower than 60 is called bradycardia. An occasional extra heartbeat is known as  extrasystole . Palpitations are not serious most of the time. Sensations representing an abnormal heart rhythm ( arrhythmia ) may be more serious. The following conditions make you more likely to have an abnormal heart rhythm: 
 
 Known heart disease at the time the palpitations begin 
 Significant risk factors for heart disease 
 An abnormal heart valve 
 An electrolyte abnormality in your blood -- for example, a low potassium level

 Causes 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Heart palpitations can be due to: 
 
 Anxiety, stress, panic attack, or fear 
 Caffeine intake 
 Nicotine intake 
 Cocaine or other illegal drugs 
 Diet pills 
 Exercise 
 Fever 
 
 However, some palpitations are due to an abnormal heart rhythm, which may be caused by: 
 
 Heart disease 
 Abnormal heart valve, such as mitral valve prolapse 
 Abnormal blood level of potassium 
 Certain medicines, including those used to treat asthma, high blood pressure, or heart problems 
 Overactive thyroid 
 Low level of oxygen in your blood 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Home Care 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Things you can do to limit palpitations include: 
 
 Lower your intake of caffeine and nicotine. This will often reduce heart palpitations. 
 Learn to  reduce stress and anxiety . This can help prevent palpitations and help you better manage them when they occur. 
 Try deep relaxation or breathing exercises. 
 Practice yoga, meditation, or tai chi. 
 Get regular exercise. 
 Do not smoke. 
 
 
 Once a serious cause has been ruled out by your provider, try not to pay close attention to heart palpitations. This may cause stress. However, contact your provider if you notice a sudden increase or a change in them. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When to Contact a Medical Professional 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 If you have never had heart palpitations before, see your health care provider. Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have: 
 
 Loss of alertness (consciousness) 
 Chest pain 
 Shortness of breath 
 Unusual sweating 
 Dizziness  or lightheadedness 
 
 Call your doctor right away if: 
 
 You often feel extra heartbeats (more than 6 per minute or coming in groups of 3 or more). 
 You have risk factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol, diabetes, or high blood pressure. 
 You have new or different heart palpitations. 
 Your  pulse  is more than 100 beats per minute (without exercise, anxiety, or fever). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 What to Expect at Your Office Visit 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Your provider will examine you and ask questions about your medical history and symptoms. You may be asked: 
 
 Do you feel skipped or stopped beats? 
 Does your heart rate feel slow or fast when you have the palpitations? 
 Do you feel a racing, pounding, or fluttering? 
 Is there a regular or irregular pattern to the unusual heartbeat sensations? 
 Did the palpitations begin or end suddenly? 
 When do the palpitations occur? In response to reminders of a traumatic event? When you are lying down and resting? When you change your body position? When you feel emotional? 
 Do you have any other symptoms? 
 
 An  electrocardiogram  will be done. In the emergency room, you will be connected to a heart monitor. If your provider finds you have an abnormal heart rhythm, other tests may be done. This may include: 
 
 Holter monitor  for 24 hours, or another heart monitor for two weeks or longer 
 Echocardiogram 
 Electrophysiology study  (EPS) 
 Coronary angiography
