 Trypsinogen is a substance that is normally produced in the pancreas and released into the small intestine. Trypsinogen is converted to trypsin. Then it starts the process needed to break down proteins into their building blocks (called amino acids). A test can be done to measure the amount of trypsinogen in your blood. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample is taken from a vein . The blood sample is sent to a lab for testing. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 There are no special preparations. How the Test will Feel 
 
 You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted to draw blood. Afterward, there may be some throbbing. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is done to detect diseases of the pancreas. The test is also used to screen newborn babies for cystic fibrosis. Normal Results 
 
 Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Increased levels of trypsinogen may be due to: Abnormal production of pancreatic enzymes Acute pancreatitis Cystic fibrosis Pancreatic cancer Low or normal levels may be seen in  chronic pancreatitis . Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size so it may be harder to get a blood sample from one person than another. Other slight risks from having blood drawn may include: Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling light-headed Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Considerations 
 
 Other tests used to detect pancreas diseases may include: Serum amylase Serum lipase  Alternative Names
