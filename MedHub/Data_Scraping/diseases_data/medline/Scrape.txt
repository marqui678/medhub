 A scrape is an area where the skin is rubbed off. It usually occurs after you fall or hit something. A scrape is often not serious. But it can be painful and may bleed slightly. First Aid 
 
 A scrape is often dirty. Even if you do not see dirt, the scrape can get infected. Take these steps to clean the area thoroughly.  Wash your hands. Then wash the scrape thoroughly with mild soap and water. Large pieces of dirt or debris should be removed with tweezers. Clean the tweezers with soap and water before use. If available, apply antibiotic ointment. Apply a non-stick bandage. Change the bandage once or twice a day until the scrape has healed. If the scrape is very small, or on the face or scalp, you can let it air dry. When to Contact a Medical Professional
