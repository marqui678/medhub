 A cerebrospinal fluid smear is a laboratory test to look for bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the fluid that moves in the space around the spinal cord and brain. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protects the brain and spinal cord from injury. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A sample of CSF is needed. This is usually done with a lumbar puncture, or a  spinal tap . The sample is sent to a laboratory. There, a tiny amount is spread on a glass slide. Laboratory staff then view the sample under a microscope. The smear shows the color of the fluid and the number and shape of cells present in the fluid. Other tests may be done to check for bacteria or fungi in the sample. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Follow instructions on how to prepare for a  spinal tap . Why the Test is Performed 
 
 Your health care provider may order this test if you have signs of an infection that affects the brain or nervous system. The test helps identify what is causing the infection. This will help your provider decide on the best treatment Normal Results 
 
 A normal test result means there are no signs of an infection. This is also called a negative result. However, a normal result doesn't mean that there is no infection. The spinal tap and CSF smear may need to be done again. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Bacteria or other germs found in the sample may be a sign of meningitis. This is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. The infection can be caused by  bacteria , fungi, or viruses. Risks
