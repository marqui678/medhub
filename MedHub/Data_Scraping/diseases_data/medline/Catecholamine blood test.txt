 This test measures the levels of catecholamines in the blood. Catecholamines are hormones made by the adrenal glands.  Catecholamines are more often measured with a  urine test  than with a blood test. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 You will likely be told not to eat anything (fast) for 10 hours before the test. You may be allowed to drink water during this time. The accuracy of the test can be affected by certain foods and medicines. Foods that can increase catecholamine levels include: Coffee Tea Bananas Chocolate Cocoa Citrus fruits Vanilla  You should not eat these foods for several days before the test. This is especially true if both blood and urine catecholamines are to be measured. You should also avoid stressful situations and vigorous exercise. Both can affect the accuracy of the test results.  Medicines and substances that can increase catecholamine measurements include: Acetaminophen Albuterol Aminophylline Amphetamines Buspirone Caffeine Calcium channel blockers Cocaine Cyclobenzaprine Levodopa Methyldopa Nicotinic acid  (large doses) Phenoxybenzamine Phenothiazines Pseudoephedrine Reserpine Tricyclic antidepressants  Medicines that can decrease catecholamine measurements include: Clonidine Guanethidine MAO inhibitors  If you take any of the above medicines, check with your health care provider before the blood test about whether you should stop taking your medicine. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel slight pain. Others feel a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 Catecholamines are released into the blood when a person is under physical or emotional stress. The main catecholamines are dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine (which used to be called adrenalin). This test is used to diagnose or rule out certain rare tumors, such as  pheochromocytoma  or  neuroblastoma . It may also be done in patients with those conditions to determine if treatment is working. Normal Results 
 
 The normal range for epinephrine is 0 to 900 pg/mL. The normal range for norepinephrine is 0 to 600 pg/mL. Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Higher-than-normal levels of blood catecholamines may suggest: Acute anxiety Ganglioblastoma  (very rare tumor) Ganglioneuroma  (very rare tumor) Neuroblastoma  (rare tumor) Pheochromocytoma  (rare tumor) Severe stress  Additional conditions under which the test may be performed include  Shy-Drager syndrome .  Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Alternative Names 
 
 Norepinephrine -- blood; Epinephrine -- blood; Adrenalin -- blood; Dopamine -- blood Images
