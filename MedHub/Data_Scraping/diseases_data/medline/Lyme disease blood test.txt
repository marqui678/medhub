 The Lyme disease blood test looks for antibodies in the blood to the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. The test is used to help diagnose Lyme disease. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed.  A laboratory specialist looks for  Lyme disease  
 antibodies in the blood sample using the  ELISA test . If the ELISA test is positive, it must be confirmed with another test called the Western blot test. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 You do not need special steps to prepare for this test. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 The test is done to help confirm the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Normal Results 
 
 A negative test result is normal. This means none or few  antibodies  to Lyme disease were seen in your blood sample. If the ELISA test is negative, usually no other testing is needed. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 A positive ELISA result is abnormal. This means antibodies were seen in your blood sample. But, this does not confirm a diagnosis of Lyme disease. A positive ELISA result must be followed up with a Western blot test. Only a positive Western blot test can confirm the diagnosis of Lyme disease. For many people, the ELISA test remains positive, even after they have been treated for Lyme disease and no longer have symptoms. A positive ELISA test may also occur with certain diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size, so it may be harder to take a blood sample from one person than another. Other slight risks from having blood drawn may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Alternative Names
