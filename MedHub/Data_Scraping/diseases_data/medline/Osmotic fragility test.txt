 Osmotic fragility is a blood test to detect whether red blood cells are more likely to break down. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed. In the laboratory, red blood cells are tested with a solution that makes them swell. This determines how fragile they are. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 No special preparation is necessary for this test. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is done to detect conditions called  hereditary spherocytosis  and  thalassemia . Hereditary spherocytosis makes red blood cells more fragile than normal. With thalassemia, some red blood cells are more fragile than normal, but more of them are less fragile than normal. Normal Results 
 
 A normal test result is called a negative result. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 An abnormal result indicates 1 of these conditions: Thalassemia
    Hereditary spherocytosis Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Alternative Names
