Disorders that may result when a particular gland does not produce the right amount of hormones include: Adrenal: Addison disease Adrenogenital syndrome  or adrenocortical hyperplasia Cushing syndrome Pheochromocytoma Pancreas: Diabetes Hypoglycemia Parathyroid: Tetany Renal calculi Excessive loss of minerals from bone  Pituitary: Growth hormone deficiency Acromegaly Diabetes Gigantism Diabetes insipidus Cushing Disease  Watch this video about: Pituitary gland Testes and ovaries: Lack of sex development (unclear genitalia)  Thyroid: Congenital hypothyroidism Myxedema Goiter Thyrotoxicosis Images
