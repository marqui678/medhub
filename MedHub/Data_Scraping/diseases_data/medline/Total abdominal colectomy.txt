The surgeon will remove your large intestine. Your rectum and anus will be left in place. Your surgeon will sew the end of your small intestine to your rectum.  Today, some surgeons perform this operation using a camera. The surgery is done with a few small surgical cuts, and sometimes a larger cut big enough for the surgeon to assist with the operation.
