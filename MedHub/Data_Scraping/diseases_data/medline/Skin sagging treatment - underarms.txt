 Loose skin and tissue under the upper arms is common. It may be caused by aging, weight loss, or other reasons. The muscles in the back of your arms are called the triceps. To tone these muscles, try push-ups or other triceps-building exercises. If this does not work, you may want to talk to your health care provider about cosmetic arm-lift surgery or laser treatments. Consulting a plastic surgeon is a good idea. Alternative Names
