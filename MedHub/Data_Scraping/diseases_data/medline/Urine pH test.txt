 A urine pH test measures the level of acid in urine. How the Test is Performed 
 
 After you provide a urine sample, it is tested right away. The health care provider uses a dipstick made with a color-sensitive pad. The color change on the dipstick tells the provider the level of acid in your urine. If needed, the provider may ask you to collect your urine at home over 24 hours. Your provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Your provider may tell you to stop taking certain medicines that can affect the results of the test. These may include: Acetazolamide Ammonium chloride Methenamine mandelate Potassium citrate Sodium bicarbonate Thiazide diuretic  DO NOT stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider. Eat a normal, balanced diet for several days before the test. Note that: A diet high in fruits, vegetables, or non-cheese dairy products can increase your urine pH. A diet high in fish, meat products, or cheese can decrease your urine pH. How the Test will Feel 
 
 The test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 Your provider may order this test to check for changes in your urine acid levels. It may be done to see if you: Are at risk of  kidney stones . Different types of stones can form depending on how acidic your urine is. Need to take certain medicines to treat urinary tract infections. Some medicines are more effective when urine is acidic or non-acidic (alkaline). Normal Results 
 
 The normal values range from pH 4.6 to pH 8.0. The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 A high urine pH may be due to: Kidneys that do not properly remove acids (kidney tubular acidosis, also known as renal tubular acidosis) Kidney failure Stomach pumping (gastric suction) Urinary tract infection Vomiting A low urine pH may be due to: Diabetic ketoacidosis Diarrhea Too much acid in the body fluids ( metabolic acidosis ), such as  diabetic ketoacidosis Starvation Risks
