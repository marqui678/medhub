 The uvea is the middle layer of the eye. It lies beneath the white part of the eye (the  sclera ). It is made of the  iris ,  ciliary body , and  choroid . These structures control many eye functions, including adjusting to different levels of light or distances of objects. Inflammation of one or more of these structures is called uveitis.
