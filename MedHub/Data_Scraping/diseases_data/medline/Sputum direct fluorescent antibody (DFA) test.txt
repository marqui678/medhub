 You will produce a sputum sample from your lungs by coughing up mucus from deep inside your lungs. (Mucus is not the same as saliva or spit from the mouth.) The sample is sent to a lab. There, a fluorescent dye is added to the sample. If the micro-organism is present, a bright glow (fluorescence) can be seen in the sputum sample using a special microscope.
