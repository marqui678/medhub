 White blood cells fight infections from bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other germs. One important type of white blood cell is the granulocyte, which is made in the bone marrow and travels in the blood throughout the body. Granulocytes sense infections, gather at sites of infection, and destroy the germs. When the body has too few granulocytes, the condition is called agranulocytosis. This makes it harder for the body to fight off germs. As a result, the person is more likely to get sick from infections. Causes 
 
 Agranulocytosis may be caused by: Autoimmune disorders Bone marrow diseases, such as myelodysplasia or large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia Certain medicines used to treat diseases, including cancer Certain street drugs Poor nutrition Preparation for  bone marrow transplant Problem with genes Symptoms 
 
 People with this condition are more likely to have fevers andÂ infections. Exams and Tests 
 
 A  blood differential  test will be done to measure the percentage of each type of white blood cell in your blood. Treatment 
 
 Treatment depends on the cause of the low white blood cell count. For example, if a medicine is the cause, stopping or changing to another drug may help. In other cases, medicines to help the body make more white blood cells will be used. Outlook (Prognosis) 
 
 Treating or removing the cause often results in a good outcome. Prevention 
 
 If you are having treatment or taking medicine that could cause agranulocytosis, your health care provider will use blood tests to monitor you. Alternative Names
