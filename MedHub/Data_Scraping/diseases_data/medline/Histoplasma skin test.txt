 Histoplasma skin test is a method to check if you have been exposed to a fungus called  Histoplasma capsulatum.  The fungus causes an infection called histoplasmosis. How the Test is Performed 
 
 The health care provider cleans an area of your skin, usually the forearm. An  allergen  is injected just below the cleaned skin surface. The injection site is checked at 24 hours and at 48 hours for signs of a reaction. Occasionally, the reaction may not appear until the fourth day. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 No special preparation is necessary for this test. How the Test will Feel 
 
 You may feel a brief sting as the needle is inserted just below the skin. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is used to determine if you have been exposed to the fungus that causes  histoplasmosis . Normal Results 
 
 No reaction (inflammation) at the site of the test is normal. The skin test can rarely make histoplasmosis antibody tests turn positive. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 A reaction means you have been exposed to  Histoplasma capsulatum . It does not always mean you have an active infection. Risks 
 
 There is a slight risk of  anaphylactic shock  (a severe reaction). Considerations 
 
 This test is rarely used today. It has been replaced by a variety of blood and urine tests. Images
