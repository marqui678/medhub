 TSI stands for thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin. TSIs are  antibodies  that tell the thyroid gland to become more active and release excess amounts of thyroid hormone into the blood. A TSI test measures the amount of thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin in your blood. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed.  How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 No special preparation is usually necessary. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 Your health care provider may recommend this test if you have signs or symptoms of an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), including symptoms of: Graves disease Toxic multinodular goiter Thyroiditis (swelling of the thyroid gland caused by an overactive immune system)  The test is also done during the last 3 months of pregnancy to predict Graves disease in the baby. The TSI test is most commonly done if you have signs or symptoms of hyperthyroidism but are unable to have a test called  thyroid uptake and scan . Normal Results 
 
 Normal values are less than 130% of basal activity. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 A higher-than-normal level may indicate: Graves disease (most common) Hashitoxicosis (very rare) Neonatal thyrotoxicosis  Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names 
 
 TSH receptor stimulating antibody; Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin; Hypothyroidism - TSI; Hyperthyroidism - TSI; Goiter - TSI; Thyroiditis - TSI  References
