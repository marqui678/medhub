 Lipase is a protein ( enzyme ) released by the pancreas into the small intestine. It helps the body absorb fat. This test is used to measure the amount of the lipase in the blood. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A sample of  blood will be taken from a vein .  How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 DO NOT eat for 8 hours before the test. Your health care provider may ask you to stop taking medicines that may affect the test, such as: Bethanechol Birth control pills Cholinergic medications Codeine Indomethacin Meperidine Methacholine Morphine Thiazide diuretics  How the Test will Feel 
 
 You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted to draw blood. There may be some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn. Veins and arteries vary in size so it may be harder to take a blood sample from one person than another. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is done to check for disease of the pancreas, most often  acute pancreatitis . Lipase appears in the blood when the pancreas is damaged. Normal Results 
 
 In general, normal results are 0 to 160 units per liter (U/L) or 0 to 2.67 microkat/L (Âµkat/L). Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your test results. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Higher-than-normal levels may be due to: Blockage of the bowel  (bowel obstruction) Celiac disease Duodenal ulcer Cancer  of the pancreas Infection or swelling of the pancreas This test may also be done for  familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency . Risks 
 
 There is very little risk from your blood taken.  Other uncommon risks may include: Bleeding from the needle puncture site Fainting or feeling light-headed Blood collecting under the skin Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Images
