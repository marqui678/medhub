 Your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free  Poison Help hotline  (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room 
 
 Take the medicine container with you to the hospital, if possible.  The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. The person may receive:  Activated charcoal Blood and urine tests Breathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs and breathing machine (ventilator) Chest x-ray EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) Intravenous fluids (given through a vein) Laxatives Medicine to treat symptoms Tube through the nose into the stomach to to determine if there is internal bleeding Outlook (Prognosis) 
 
 Most people who overdose on corticosteroids have minor changes in their body’s fluids and electrolytes. If they have changes in their heart rhythm, their outlook may be more serious. Some problems related to taking corticosteroids may occur even when they are taken properly. People who have these problems may need to take both short- and long-term medicines to treat these problems. References
