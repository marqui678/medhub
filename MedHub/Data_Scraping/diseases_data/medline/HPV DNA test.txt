 The HPV DNA test is used to check for high-risk HPV infection in women.  HPV infection around the genitals is common. It can be spread during sex.  Some types of HPV can cause cervical cancer and other cancers. These are called high-risk types. Low-risk types of HPV may cause  genital warts  in the vagina, cervix, and on the skin. The virus and warts spread when you have sex. The HPV-DNA test is generally not recommended for detecting low-risk HPV infections.  How the Test is Performed 
 
 The HPV DNA test may be done during a  Pap smear . You lie on a table and place your feet in stirrups. The health care provider places an instrument (called a speculum) into the vagina and opens it slightly to see inside. Cells are gently collected from the cervix area. The cervix is the lower part of the womb (uterus) that opens at the top of the vagina. The cells are sent to a laboratory for examination under a microscope. This examiner checks to see if the cells contain genetic material (called DNA) from types of HPV that cause cancer. More tests may be done to determine the exact type of HPV.  How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Avoid the following for 24 hours before the test: Douching Having intercourse Taking a bath Using tampons  Empty your bladder just before the test. How the Test will Feel 
 
 The exam may cause some discomfort. Some women say it feels like menstrual cramps.  You may also feel some pressure during the exam. You may bleed a little bit after the test. Why the Test is Performed
