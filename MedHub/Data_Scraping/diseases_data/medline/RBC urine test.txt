 The RBC urine test measures the number of red blood cells in a urine sample. How the Test is Performed

If needed, the health care provider may ask you to  collect your urine at home over 24 hours . Your provider will tell you how to do this.  A  clean-catch urine sample  is needed. The clean-catch method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, the provider may give you a special clean-catch kit that contains a cleansing solution and sterile wipes. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.
