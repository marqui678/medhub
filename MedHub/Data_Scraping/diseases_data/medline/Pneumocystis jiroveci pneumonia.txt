 Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia is a fungal infection of the lungs. The disease used to be called  Pneumocystis carini  or PCP pneumonia. Causes 
 
 This type of pneumonia is caused by the fungus  Pneumocystis jiroveci . This fungus is common in the environment and rarely causes illness in healthy people. However, it can cause a lung infection in people with a weakened immune system due to: Cancer Long-term use of corticosteroids or other medicines that weaken the immune system  HIV/AIDS Organ or bone marrow transplant Pneumocystis jiroveci  was a rare infection before the AIDS epidemic. Before the use of preventive antibiotics for the condition, most people in the United States with advanced AIDS often developed this infection. Symptoms 
 
 Pneumocystis pneumonia in people with AIDS usually develops slowly over days to weeks or even months, and is less severe. People with pneumocystis pneumonia who do not have AIDS usually get sick faster and are more severely ill. Symptoms include: Cough, often mild and dry Fever Rapid breathing Shortness of breath, especially with activity (exertion) Exams and Tests 
 
 Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. Tests that may be ordered include: Blood gases Bronchoscopy  (with lavage) Lung biopsy X-ray of the chest Sputum exam to check for fungus that causes the infection CBC ÃŸ-1,3 glucan level in the blood  Treatment 
 
  Anti-infection medicines can be given by mouth (orally) or through a vein ( intravenously ), depending on how severe the illness is. People with low oxygen levels and moderate to severe disease are often prescribed corticosteroids as well. Outlook (Prognosis) 
 
 Pneumocystis pneumonia can be life threatening, causing respiratory failure that can lead to death. People with this condition need early and effective treatment. For moderate to severe pneumocystis pneumonia in people with HIV/AIDS, the short term use of corticosteroids has decreased the incidence of death. Possible Complications 
 
 Complications that may result include: Pleural effusion  (extremely rare) Pneumothorax  (collapsed lung) Respiratory  failure (may require breathing support) When to Contact a Medical Professional 
 
 If you have a weakened immune system due to AIDS, cancer, transplantation, or corticosteroid use, call your provider if you develop a cough, fever, or shortness of breath. Prevention 
 
 Preventive therapy is recommended for: People with HIV/AIDS who have CD4 counts below 200 cells/microliter Bone marrow transplant recipients Organ transplant recipients People who take long-term, high-dose corticosteroids People who have had previous episodes of this infection People who take long-term immunomodulatory drugs Alternative Names
