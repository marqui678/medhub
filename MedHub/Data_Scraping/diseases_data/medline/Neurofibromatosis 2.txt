 Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is a disorder in which tumors form on the nerves of the brain and spine (the central nervous system). It is passed down (inherited) in families. Although it has a similar name to  neurofibromatosis type 1 , it is a different and separate condition. Causes 
 
 NF2 can be passed down through families in an  autosomal dominant  pattern. This means that if 1 parent has NF2, any child of that parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition. The main risk factor is having a family history of the condition. Symptoms 
 
 Symptoms of NF2 include: Balance problems Cataracts  at a young age Changes in vision Coffee-colored marks on the skin (caf√©-au-lait) Headaches Hearing loss Ringing and noises in the ears Weakness of the face  Exams and Tests 
 
 Signs of NF2 include: Brain and spinal tumors Hearing-related (acoustic) tumors Skin tumors  Tests include: Genetic testing Medical history MRI Physical examination  Treatment 
 
 Acoustic tumors can be observed, or treated with surgery or  radiation . People with this disorder may benefit from genetic counseling. People with NF2 should be regularly evaluated with these tests: MRI of the brain and spinal cord Hearing and speech evaluation Eye exam Support Groups 
 
 A support group can be helpful for emotional support and for giving and receiving practical advice. For information and support, visit  www.ctf.org . Alternative Names
