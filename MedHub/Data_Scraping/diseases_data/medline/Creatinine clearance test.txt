 The creatinine clearance test helps provide information about how well the kidneys are working. The test compares the creatinine level in urine with the creatinine level in blood.  How the Test is Performed 
 
 This test requires both a  urine sample  and  blood sample . You will  collect your urine for 24 hours  and then have blood taken. Follow instructions exactly. This ensures accurate results. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Your health care provider may ask you to temporarily stop any medicines that may affect the test results. These include antibiotics and stomach acid medicines. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take.  DO NOT stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider. How the Test will Feel 
 
 The urine test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort. When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 Creatinine is a chemical waste product of creatine. Creatine is a chemical the body makes to supply energy, mainly to muscles. By comparing the  creatinine level in urine  with the  creatinine level in blood , this test estimates the  glomerular filtration rate (GFR) . GFR is a measure of how well the kidneys are working, especially the kidneys' filtering units. These filtering units are called glomeruli. Creatinine is removed, or cleared, from the body entirely by the kidneys. If kidney function is abnormal, creatinine level increases in the blood because less creatinine is released through the urine.  Normal Results 
 
 Clearance is often measured as milliliters per minute (mL/min) or milliliters per second (mL/s). Normal values are: Male: 97 to 137 mL/min (1.65 to 2.33 mL/s). Female: 88 to 128 mL/min (14.96 to 2.18 mL/s).  Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.  What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Abnormal results (lower than normal creatinine clearance) may indicate: 
  Kidney problems, such as  damage to the tubule cells Kidney failure Too little blood flow to the kidneys Damage to the filtering units of the kidneys Loss of body fluids (dehydration) Bladder outlet obstruction 
  Heart failure
   Risks 
 
 Risks of the test involve the blood draw process. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.  Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Images
