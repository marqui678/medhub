 Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a protein found in all body tissues. Tissues with higher amounts of ALP include the liver,  bile  ducts, and bone. A blood test can be done to measure the level of ALP. A related test is the  ALP isoenzyme test .  How the Test is Performed 
 
 A blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is  drawn from a vein  located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.  How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 You should not to eat or drink anything for 6 hours before the test, unless your health care provider tells you otherwise.  Many medicines can interfere with blood test results. Your provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test. DO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.  How the Test will Feel 
 
 You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 Reasons the test may be done include: To diagnose liver or bone disease To check, if treatments for those diseases are working As part of a routine liver function test  Normal Results 
 
 The normal range is 44 to 147 IU/L (international units per liter) or 0.73 to 2.45 microkat/L. Normal values may vary slightly from laboratory to laboratory. They also can vary with age and gender. High levels of ALP are normally seen in children undergoing growth spurts and in pregnant women. The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Abnormal results may be due to the following conditions: Higher-than-normal ALP levels Biliary obstruction Bone conditions Osteoblastic bone tumors ,  osteomalacia , a fracture that is healing Liver disease or  hepatitis Eating a fatty meal if you have blood type O or B Hyperparathyroidism Leukemia Lymphoma Paget disease Rickets Sarcoidosis  Lower-than-normal ALP levels Hypophosphatasia Malnutrition Protein  deficiency Wilson disease  Other conditions for which the test may be done: Alcoholic liver disease (hepatitis/cirrhosis) Alcoholism Biliary stricture Gallstones Giant cell (temporal, cranial) arteritis Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) II Pancreatitis Renal cell carcinoma Alternative Names
