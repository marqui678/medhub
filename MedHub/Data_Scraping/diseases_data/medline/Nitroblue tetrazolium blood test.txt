 The nitroblue tetrazolium test checks if certain immune system cells can change a colorless chemical called nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) into a deep blue color. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed.  The chemical NBT is added to the white blood cells in the lab. The cells are then examined under a microscope to see if the chemical has made them turn blue. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 No special preparation is needed. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is done to screen for  chronic granulomatous disease . This disorder is passed down in families. In people who have this disease, certain immune cells do not help protect the body from infections. People who have frequent infections in the bones, skin, joints, lungs, and other parts of the body may have this test done. Normal Results 
 
 Normally, the white blood cells turn blue when NBT is added. This means that the cells should be able to kill bacteria and protect the person from infections. Normal value ranges may vary slightly from one lab to another. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 If the sample does not change color when NBT is added, the white blood cells are missing the substance needed to kill bacteria. This may be due to chronic granulomatous disease. Risks 
 
 There is very little risk involved with having blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size so taking blood may be harder in some people than in others. Other slight risks from having blood drawn may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Alternative Names
