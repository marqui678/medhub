 An estradiol test measures the amount of a hormone called estradiol in the blood. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample is needed . How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Your health care provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking certain medicines that may affect test results. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take. These include: Birth control pills Antibiotics such as ampicillin or tetracycline Corticosteroids DHEA (a supplement) Estrogen Medicine to manage mental disorders (such as phenothiazine) Testosterone Do not stop taking any medicine before talking to your doctor. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 In women, most estradiol is released from the ovaries and adrenal glands. It is also released by the placenta during pregnancy. Estradiol plays a role in:  Growth of the womb (uterus), fallopian tubes, and vagina Breast development  Changes of the outer genitals  Distribution of body fat  In men, a small amount of estradiol is mainly released by the testes. Estradiol helps prevent sperm from dying too early.  This test may be ordered to check: How well your ovaries, placenta, or adrenal glands work If you have signs of an ovarian tumor  If male or female body characteristics are not developing normally If your periods have stopped (levels of estradiol vary, depending on the time of month) The test may also be ordered to check if: Hormone therapy is working for women in  menopause A woman is responding to fertility treatment The test may also be used to monitor people with  hypopituitarism  and women on certain fertility treatments. Normal Results 
 
 The results may vary, depending on the person's gender and age. Male: 10 to 50 pg/mL Female (premenopausal): 30 to 400 pg/mL Female (postmenopausal): 0 to 30 pg/mL Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test result. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Disorders that are associated with abnormal estradiol results include: Early (precocious) puberty  in girls  Growth of abnormally large breasts in men ( gynecomastia ) Lack of periods in women ( amenorrhea ) Reduced function of the ovaries ( ovarian hypofunction ) Problem with genes, such as Klinefelter syndrome,  Turner syndrome Rapid weight loss or low body fat Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names
