 Coccidioides precipitin is a blood test that looks for infections due to a fungus called Coccidioides, which causes the disease  coccidioidomycosis . How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample is needed . The sample is sent to a laboratory. There, it is examined for bands called precipitin that form when  antibodies  are present. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 There is no special preparation for the test. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, you may feel moderate pain, or only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or bruising. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 The precipitin test is one of several tests that can be done to determine if you are infected with the fungus Coccidioides, which causes the disease coccidioidomycosis. Antibodies defend the body against bacteria, viruses, and fungi. These and other foreign substances are called  antigens . When you are exposed to antigens, your body produces antibodies. The precipitin test helps check if the body has produced antibodies to a specific antigen, in this case, the Coccidioides 
 fungus.   Normal Results 
 
 A normal result is when no precipitins are formed. This means the blood test did not detect the antibody to Coccidioides. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 An abnormal (positive) result means the antibody to Coccidioides 
 has been detected. In this case, another test is done to confirm that you have an infection. Your doctor can tell you more. During the early stage of an illness, few antibodies may be detected. Antibody production increases during the course of an infection. For this reason, this test may be repeated several weeks after the first test.  Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names
