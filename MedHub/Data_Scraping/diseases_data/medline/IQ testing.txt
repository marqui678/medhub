 IQ (intelligence quotient) testing is a series of exams used to determine your general intelligence in relation to other people the same age. Information 
 
 Many IQ tests are used today. Whether they measure actual intelligence or simply certain abilities is controversial. IQ tests measure a specific functioning ability and may not accurately assess a person's talents or future potential. Results of any intelligence test may be culturally biased. The more widely used tests include: Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales Differential Ability Scales Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children.  Functioning abilities that are measured by these tests include language, mathematical, analytical, spatial (for example, reading a map), among others. Each test has its own scoring system.  In general, IQ tests are only one way to measure how well a person functions. Other factors, such as genetics and environment, should be considered. Alternative Names
