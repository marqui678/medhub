 A chest x-ray is an  x-ray  of the chest, lungs, heart, large arteries, ribs, and diaphragm. How the Test is Performed 
 
 You stand in front of the x-ray machine. You will be told to hold your breath when the x-ray is taken. Two images are usually taken. You will first need to stand facing the machine, and then sideways.  How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Tell the health care providerÂ if you are pregnant. Chest x-rays are generally not done during the first 6 months of pregnancy.  How the Test will Feel 
 
 There is no discomfort. The film plate may feel cold. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 Your doctor may order a chest x-ray if you have any of the following symptoms: A persistent cough Chest pain  from a chest injury (with a possible rib fracture or lung complication) or from heart problems Coughing up blood Difficulty breathing Fever It may also be done if you have signs of  tuberculosis ,  lung cancer , or other chest or  lung diseases . A serial chest x-ray is one that is repeated. It may be done to monitor changes found on a past chest x-ray. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Abnormal results may be due to many things, including: In the lungs: Collapsed lung Collection of fluid around the lung Lung tumor (noncancerous or cancerous)  Malformation of the blood vessels Pneumonia Scarring of lung tissue Tuberculosis  In the heart: Problems with the size or shape of the heart Problems with the position and shape of the large arteries  Evidence of heart failure In the bones: Fractures  or other problems of the ribs and spine Osteoporosis Risks 
 
 There is low radiation exposure. X-rays are monitored and regulated to provide the minimum amount of radiation exposure needed to produce the image. Most experts feel that the benefits outweigh the risks. Pregnant women and children are more sensitive to the risks of x-rays. Alternative Names
