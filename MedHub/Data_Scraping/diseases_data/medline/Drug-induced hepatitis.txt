 Drug-induced hepatitis is inflammation of the liver that may occur when you take certain medicines. Other types of hepatitis include: Hepatitis A Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Hepatitis D Causes 
 
 The liver helps the body break down certain medicines. These include some drugs that you buy over-the-counter or your health care provider prescribes for you. However, the process is slower in some people. This can make you more likely to get liver damage. Some drugs can cause hepatitis with small doses, even if the liver breakdown system is normal. Large doses of many medicines can damage a normal liver. Many different drugs can cause drug-induced hepatitis. Painkillers and fever reducers that contain acetaminophen are a common cause of liver inflammation. These medicines can damage the liver when taken in doses that are not much greater than the recommended dose. People who already have liver disease are most likely to have this problem. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen, may also cause drug-induced hepatitis. Other drugs that can lead to liver inflammation include: Amiodarone Anabolic steroids Birth control pills Chlorpromazine Erythromycin Halothane (a type of anesthesia) Methyldopa Isoniazid Methotrexate Statins Sulfa drugs Tetracyclines Amoxicillin-clavulanate Some anti-seizure medicines  Symptoms 
 
 Symptoms may include Abdominal pain Dark urine Diarrhea Fatigue Fever Headache Jaundice Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Rash White or clay-colored stools  Exams and Tests 
 
 You will have blood tests to check liver function.  Liver enzymes  will be higher if you have the condition. Your provider will do a physical exam to check for an  enlarged liver  and  abdominal tenderness  in the right upper part of the belly area. A rash or fever may be part of some drug reactions that affect the liver. Treatment 
 
 The only specific treatment for most cases of liver damage caused by taking a drug is to stop the drug that caused the problem.  However, if you took  high doses of acetaminophen , treatment should be started as soon as possible after you develop hepatitis.  You should rest during the first phase of drug-induced hepatitis, when the symptoms are most severe. You may need to get fluids through a vein if nausea and vomiting are very bad. People with  acute hepatitis  should avoid heavy exercise, alcohol, acetaminophen, and any other substances that harm the liver. Outlook (Prognosis) 
 
 Drug-induced hepatitis most often goes away within days or weeks after you stop taking the drug that caused it. Possible Complications 
 
 Rarely, drug-induced hepatitis can lead to liver failure.  When to Contact a Medical Professional 
 
 Call your health care provider if: You develop symptoms of hepatitis after you start taking a new medicine. You have been diagnosed with drug-induced hepatitis and your symptoms do not get better after you stop taking the medicine.  You develop any new symptoms. Prevention
