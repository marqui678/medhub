 Triiodothyronine (T3) is a thyroid hormone. It plays an important role in the body's control of metabolism (the many processes the body does to function). A laboratory test can be done to measure the amount of T3 in your blood. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed.  How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before the test that may affect your test result. DO NOT stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider. Drugs that can increase T3 measurements include: Birth control pills Clofibrate Estrogens Methadone Certain herbal remedies  Drugs that can decrease T3 measurements include: Amiodarone Anabolic steroids Androgens Antithyroid drugs (for example, propylthiouracil and methimazole) Lithium Phenytoin Propranolol  How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is done to check your thyroid function. Thyroid function depends on the action of T3 and other hormones, including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and T4. Sometimes it can be useful to measure both T3 and T4 when evaluating thyroid function. The total T3 test measures the T3 that is both attached to proteins and floating free in the blood. Your provider may recommend this test if you have signs of a thyroid disorder, including: The pituitary gland does not produce normal amounts of some or all of its hormone Overactive thyroid gland Underactive thyroid gland Normal Results 
 
 The range for normal values is 100 to 200 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL) or 1.54 to 3.08 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L). Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 A higher-than-normal level of T3 may be a sign of: Overactive thyroid gland (for example,  Graves disease ) T3  thyrotoxicosis  (rare) Toxic nodular goiter Taking thyroid medicines or certain supplements (common) Liver disease  A high level of T3 may occur in pregnancy or with the use of birth control pills or estrogen. A lower-than-normal level may be due to: Severe short-term or some long-term illnesses Thyroiditis (swelling or inflammation of the thyroid gland --  Hashimoto disease  is the most common type) Starvation Underactive thyroid gland  Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names
