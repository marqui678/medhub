 The growth hormone test measures the amount of growth hormone in the blood. The pituitary gland makes growth hormone, which causes a child to grow. This gland is located at the base of the brain. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed.  How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Your health care provider may give you special instructions about what you can or cannot eat before the test. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This hormone may be checked if a person's growth pattern is abnormal or if another condition is suspected.  Too much growth hormone (GH) can cause abnormally increased growth patterns. In adults this is called  acromegaly . In children it is called  gigantism . Too little growth hormone  can cause a slow or flat rate of growth in  children . In adults it can cause changes in energy, muscle mass, cholesterol levels, and bone strength.  The GH test may also be used to monitor response to acromegaly treatment. Normal Results 
 
 The normal range for GH level is typically: 1 through 9 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) for males 1 through 16 ng/mL for females  GH is released in pulses. The size and duration of the pulses varies with time of day, age, and gender. This is why random GH measurements are rarely useful. A higher level may be normal if the blood was drawn during a pulse. A lower level may be normal if the blood was drawn around the end of a pulse. GH is most useful when measured as part of a stimulation or suppression test. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 A high level of GH may indicate: Too much GH in adults, called acromegaly. (A  special test  is done to confirm this diagnosis.) Abnormal growth due to excess GH during childhood, called gigantism. (A  special test  is done to confirm this diagnosis.) GH resistance. Pituitary tumor .  A low level of GH may indicate: Slow growth noticed in infancy or childhood, caused by low levels of GH (A  special test  is done to confirm this diagnosis.) Hypopituitarism  (low function of the pituitary gland.)  Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names
