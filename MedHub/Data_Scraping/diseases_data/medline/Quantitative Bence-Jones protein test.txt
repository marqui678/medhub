 This test measures the level of abnormal proteins called Bence-Jones proteins in the urine. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  clean-catch urine sample  is needed. The clean-catch method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, the health care provider may give you a special clean-catch kit that contains a cleansing solution and sterile wipes. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate. The sample is sent to the lab. There, one of many methods is used to detect Bence-Jones proteins. One method, called  immunoelectrophoresis , is the most accurate. How the Test will Feel 
 
 The test involves only normal urination, and there is no discomfort. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 Bence-Jones proteins are a part of regular  antibodies  called light chains. These proteins are not normally in urine. Sometimes, when your body makes too many antibodies, the level of light chains also rises. Bence-Jones proteins are small enough to be filtered out by the kidneys. The proteins then spill into the urine.  Your provider may order this test: To diagnose conditions that lead to protein in the urine If you have a lot of protein in your urine If you have signs of a blood cancer called  multiple myeloma Normal Results 
 
 A normal result means no Bence-Jones proteins are found in your urine. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Bence-Jones proteins are rarely found in urine. If they are, it is usually associated with  multiple myeloma . An abnormal result may also be due to: An abnormal buildup of proteins in tissues and organs ( amyloidosis ) Blood cancer called  chronic lymphocytic leukemia Lymph system cancer (lymphoma) Buildup in the blood of a protein called M-protein (monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance; MGUS) White blood cell cancer called  Waldenström macroglobulinemia Risks 
 
 There are no risks with this test. Alternative Names
