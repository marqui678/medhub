 How well someone does depends on the amount of ketoprofen they swallowed and how quickly they receive treatment. The faster someone gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery. A mild overdose of ketoprofen does not usually cause serious problems. The person may have some stomach pain and vomiting (possibly with blood). However, a large amount of internal bleeding is possible, and a blood transfusion may be needed. Passing a tube with a camera through the mouth into the stomach may be needed to stop the internal bleeding. A large overdose can cause serious damage to children and adults. Death may occur.
