 Methemoglobinemia is a blood disorder in which the body cannot reuse hemoglobin because it is damaged. Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying molecule found in red blood cells. In some cases of methemoglobinemia, the hemoglobin is unable to carry enough oxygen to body tissues. Causes 
 
 Acquired methemoglobinemia results from exposure to certain drugs, chemicals, or foods. The condition may also be passed down through families (inherited).  Images
