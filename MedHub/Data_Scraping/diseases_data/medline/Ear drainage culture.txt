 An ear drainage culture is a lab test. This test checks for germs that can cause infection. The sample taken for this test canÂ contain fluid, pus, wax, or blood from the ear. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A sample of ear drainage is needed. Your health care provider will use a cotton swab to collect the sample from inside the outer ear canal. In some cases, a sample is collected from the middle ear during ear surgery. The sample is sent to a lab and placed on a special dish (culture media). The lab team checks the dish every day to see if bacteria, fungi, or viruses have grown. More tests may be done to look for specific germs and determine the best treatment.
