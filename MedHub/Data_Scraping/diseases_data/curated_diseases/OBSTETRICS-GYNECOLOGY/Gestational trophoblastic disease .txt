 Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is a group of conditions in which tumors grow inside a woman's uterus (womb). The abnormal cells start in the tissue that would normally become the placenta. The placenta is the organ that develops during pregnancy to feed the fetus. A baby may or may not develop during these types of pregnancies. There are several types of GTD.  Choriocarcinoma  (a type of cancer) Hydatiform mole  (also called a molar pregnancy) References
