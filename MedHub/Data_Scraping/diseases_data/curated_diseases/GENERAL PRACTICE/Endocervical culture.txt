 Endocervical culture is a laboratory test that helps identify infection in the female genital tract. How the Test is Performed 
 
 During a vaginal examination, the health care provider uses a swab to take samples of mucus and cells from the endocervix. This is the area around the opening of the uterus. The samples are sent to a lab. There, they are placed in a special dish (culture). They are then watched to see if bacteria, virus, or fungus grow. Further tests may be done to identify the specific organism and determine the best treatment. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 In the 2 days before the procedure:  Do NOT use creams or other medicines in the vagina.  Do NOT douche. (You should never douche. Douching can cause infection of the vagina or uterus.) Empty your bladder and bowel. At your providerâ€™s office, follow instructions for preparing for the vaginal exam. How the Test will Feel 
 
 You will feel some pressure from the speculum. This is an instrument inserted into the  vagina  to hold the area open so that the provider can view the  cervix  and collect the samples. There may be a slight cramping when the swab touches the cervix. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 The test may be done to determine the cause of  vaginitis , pelvic pain, an unusual  vaginal discharge , or other signs of infection. Normal Results 
 
 Organisms that are usually present in the vagina are there in the expected amounts. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Abnormal results indicate the presence of an infection in the genital tract or urinary tract in women, such as: Genital herpes Chronic swelling and irritation of the urethra ( urethritis ) Gonorrhea  or  chlamydia Pelvic inflammatory disaese  (PID) Risks 
 
 There may be slight bleeding or spotting after the test. This is normal. Alternative Names
