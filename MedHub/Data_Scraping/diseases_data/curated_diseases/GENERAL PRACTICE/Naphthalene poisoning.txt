 The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as needed. Blood and urine tests will be done. People who have recently eaten many mothballs containing naphthalene may be forced to vomit. Other treatments may include: Activated charcoal to prevent the poison from absorbing in the digestive system. Airway and breathing support, including oxygen. In extreme cases, a tube may be passed through the mouth into the lungs to prevent aspiration.Â A breathing machine (ventilator) would then be needed as well. Chest x-ray. EKG (electrocardiogram or heart tracing). Fluids through a vein (by IV). Laxatives to move the poison quickly through the body and remove it. Medicines to treat symptoms and reverse the effects of the poison. Outlook (Prognosis) 
 
 It can take several weeks or longer to recover from some of the poison's effects. If the person has  convulsions  and  coma , the outlook is not good. Alternative Names
