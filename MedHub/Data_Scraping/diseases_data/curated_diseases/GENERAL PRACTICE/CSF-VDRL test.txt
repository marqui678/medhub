 The CSF-VDRL test is used to help diagnose neurosyphilis. It looks for substances called antibodies, which are sometimes produced by the body in reaction to the syphilis-causing bacteria. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  sample of spinal fluid is needed . How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Follow the health care provider's instructions on how to prepare for this test. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 The CSF-VDRL test is done to diagnose syphilis in the brain or spinal cord. Brain and spinal cord involvement is often a sign of late-stage syphilis. Blood screening tests ( VDRL  and  RPR ) are better at detecting middle-stage (secondary) syphilis. Normal Results 
 
 A negative result is normal. False-negatives can occur. This means you can have syphilis even if this test is normal. Therefore, a negative test does not always rule out the infection. Other signs and tests may be used to diagnose  neurosyphilis . What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 A positive result is abnormal and is a sign of neurosyphilis. Alternative Names
