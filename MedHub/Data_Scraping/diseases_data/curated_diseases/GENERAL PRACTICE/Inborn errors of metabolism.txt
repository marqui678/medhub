 Inborn errors of metabolism are rare genetic (inherited) disorders in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy. The disorders are usually caused by defects in specific proteins (enzymes) that help break down (metabolize) parts of food.  A food product that is not broken down into energy can build up in the body and cause a wide range of symptoms. Several inborn errors of metabolism cause developmental delays or other medical problems if they are not controlled.  There are many different types of inborn errors of metabolism.  A few of them are: Fructose intolerance Galactosemia Maple sugar urine disease  (MSUD) Phenylketonuria  (PKU)  Newborn screening tests  can identify some of these disorders. Registered dietitians and other health care providers can help create a diet that is right for each specific disorder. Alternative Names
