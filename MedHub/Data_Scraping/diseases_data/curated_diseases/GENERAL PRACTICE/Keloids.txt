 Keloids can form after skin injuries from: Acne Burns Chickenpox Ear or body piercing Minor scratches Cuts from surgery or trauma Vaccination sites Keloids are most common in people younger than 30. Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics are more prone to developing keloids. Keloids often run in families. Sometimes, a person may not recall what injury caused a keloid to form. Symptoms 
 
 A keloid may be: Flesh-colored, red, or pink Located over the site of a wound or injury Lumpy or ridged Tender and itchy Irritated from friction such as rubbing on clothing  A keloid will tan darker than the skin around it if exposed to sun during the first year after it forms. The darker color may not go away. Exams and Tests 
 
 Your doctor will look at your skin to see if you have a keloid.Â A  skin biopsy  may be done to rule out other types of skin growths (tumors). Treatment 
 
 Keloids often DO NOT need treatment. If the keloid bothers you, these things can be done to reduce the size: Corticosteroid injections Freezing (cryotherapy) Laser treatments Radiation Surgical removal Silicone gel or patches These treatments, especially surgery, sometimes cause the keloid scar to become larger.
