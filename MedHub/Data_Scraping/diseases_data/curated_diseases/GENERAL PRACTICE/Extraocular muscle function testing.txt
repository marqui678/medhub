 Extraocular muscle function testing examines the function of the eye muscles. A health care provider observes the movement of the eyes in six specific directions. How the Test is Performed 
 
 You are asked to sit or stand with your head up and looking straight ahead. Your health care provider will hold a pen or other object about 16 inches or 40 centimeters (cm) in front of your face. The provider will then move the object in several directions and ask you to follow it with your eyes, without moving your head.  A test called a cover/uncover test may also be done. You will look at a distant object and the person doing the test will cover the other eye, then after a few seconds, uncover it. You will be asked to keep looking at the distant object. How the eye moves after it is uncovered may show problems. Then the test is performed with the other eye. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 No special preparation is necessary for this test. How the Test will Feel 
 
 The test involves only normal movement of the eyes. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is performed to evaluate weakness or other problem in the extraocular muscles. These problems may result in double vision or  rapid, uncontrolled eye movements . Normal Results 
 
 Normal movement of the eyes in all directions. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Eye movement disorders may be due to abnormalities of the muscles themselves. They may also be due to problems in the sections of the brain that control these muscles. Your health care provider will talk to you about any abnormalities that may be found.  Risks 
 
 There are no risks associated with this test. Considerations 
 
 Rapid uncontrolled eye movements,  nystagmus , may occur slightly when shifting the eyes in an extreme sideways direction. This is normal and stops quickly.  Alternative Names
