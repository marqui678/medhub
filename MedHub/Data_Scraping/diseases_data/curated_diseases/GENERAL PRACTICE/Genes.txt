 A gene is a short piece of DNA. Genes tell the body how to build specific  proteins . There are about 20,000 genes in each cell of the human body. Together, they make up the blueprint for the human body and how it works. A person's genetic makeup is called a genotype. Information 
 
 Genes are made of DNA. Strands of DNA make up part of your  chromosomes . Chromosomes have matching pairs of 1 copy of a specific gene. The gene occurs in the same position on each chromosome. Genetic traits, such as eye color, are dominant or recessive: Dominant traits are controlled by 1 gene in the pair of chromosomes. Recessive traits need both genes in the gene pair to work together. Many personal characteristics, such as height, are determined by more than 1 gene. However, some diseases, such as  sickle cell anemia , can be caused by a change in a single gene.  References
