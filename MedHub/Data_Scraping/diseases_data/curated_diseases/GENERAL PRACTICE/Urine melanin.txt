 Urine melanin is a test to determine the abnormal presence of  melanin  in the urine. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  clean-catch urine sample  is needed.  How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 No special preparation is needed. How the Test will Feel 
 
 The test involves only normal urination. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is used to diagnose melanoma, a type of skin cancer that produces melanin. If the cancer spreads (especially within the liver), the cancer may produce enough of this substance that it shows up in the urine. Normal Results 
 
 Normally, melanin is not present in urine. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 If melanin is present in the urine, malignant  melanoma  is suspected. Risks 
 
 There are no risks associated with this test. Considerations 
 
 This test is rarely done anymore to diagnose melanoma because there are better tests available. Alternative Names 
 
 Thormahlen's test; Melanin - urine Images
