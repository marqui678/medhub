 VLDL stands for very low density lipoprotein. Lipoproteins are made up of  cholesterol , triglycerides, and proteins. They move cholesterol, triglycerides, and other lipids (fats) to around the body. VLDL is one of the three main types of lipoproteins. VLDL contains the highest amount of triglycerides. VLDL is a type of "bad cholesterol" because it helps cholesterol build up on the walls of arteries. A lab test is used to measure the amount of VLDL in your blood. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is  drawn from a vein  located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.  How the Test will Feel 
 
 You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 You may have this test to help assess your risk of heart disease. Increased levels of VLDL are linked to  atherosclerosis . This condition can lead to  coronary heart disease . This test may be included in a coronary risk profile. Normal Results 
 
 Normal VLDL cholesterol level is between 2 and 30 mg/dL. Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 A high VLDL cholesterol level may be associated with a higher risk for heart disease and stroke. However, VLDL cholesterol level is rarely targeted when treatment for high cholesterol is done. Instead,  LDL cholesterol level  is more often the main target of therapy. Considerations 
 
 There is no direct way of measuring VLDL. Most labs estimate your VLDL based on your triglycerides level. It is about one fifth of your triglycerides level. This estimate is less accurate if your triglycerides level is above 400 mg/dL. Alternative Names
