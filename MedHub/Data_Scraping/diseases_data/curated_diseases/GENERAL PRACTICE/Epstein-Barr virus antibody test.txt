 Epstein-Barr virus antibody test is a blood test to detect  antibodies  to the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ). How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample is needed . The sample is sent to a lab, where a lab specialist looks for  antibodies  to the Epstein-Barr virus. In the first stages of an illness, little antibody may be detected. For this reason, the test is often repeated in 10 days to 2 or more weeks.  How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 There is no special preparation for the test. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 The test is done to detect an infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV causes  mononucleosis  or mono. The EBV antibody test detects not only a recent infection, but also one that occurred in the past. It can be used to tell the difference between a recent or previous infection. Another test for mononucleosis is called the  spot test . It is done when a person has current symptoms of mononucleosis. Normal Results 
 
 A normal result means no antibodies to EBV were seen in your blood sample. This result means you have never been infected with EBV. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 A positive result means there are antibodies to EBV in your blood. This indicates a current or prior infection with EBV. Risks 
 
 There is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names
