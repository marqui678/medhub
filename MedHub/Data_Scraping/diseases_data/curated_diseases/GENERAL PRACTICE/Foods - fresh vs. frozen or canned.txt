 Vegetables are an important part of a well-balanced diet. Many people wonder if frozen and canned vegetables are as healthy for you as fresh vegetables. Overall, vegetables fresh from the farm or just picked are healthier than frozen or canned ones. But frozen and canned vegetables can still be a good choice. They need to be canned or frozen right after being harvested, when they still have all of their healthy nutrients. Also, keep in mind how much salt is added to canned vegetables. Try to buy those without added salt and don't overcook any vegetable, whether fresh, frozen, or canned. Instead of boiling them in water for longer periods of time, they should be lightly steamed.
