 Leukocyte esterase is a urine test to look for white blood cells and other signs of infection. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  clean-catch urine sample  is preferred. The clean-catch method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, the health care provider may give you a special clean-catch kit that contains a cleansing solution and sterile wipes. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate. After you provide a urine sample, it is tested right away. The provider uses a dipstick made with a color-sensitive pad. The color of the dipstick changes to tell the provider if you have white blood cells in your urine. How to Prepare for the Test
