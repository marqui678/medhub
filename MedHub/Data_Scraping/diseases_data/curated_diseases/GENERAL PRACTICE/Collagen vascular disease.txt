 In a class of diseases known as  autoimmune disorders , the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. Some of these diseases are similar to each other such as arthritis and inflammation of arteries in the tissues. People who developed these disorders were previously said to have "connective tissue" or "collagen vascular" disease. We now have names for many of many specific conditions such as: Ankylosing spondylitis Dermatomyositis Polyarteritis nodosa Psoriatic arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Scleroderma Systemic lupus erythematosus When a specific disease cannot be diagnosed, more general terms may be used. These include as undifferentiated systemic rheumatic (connective tissue) diseases or overlap syndromes.  Images
