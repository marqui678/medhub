 Iontophoresis involves passing a weak electrical current through the skin. Iontophoresis has a variety of uses in medicine. This article discusses the use of iontophoresis to decrease sweating by blocking sweat glands. Description 
 
 The area to be treated is placed into water. A gentle current of electricity passes through the water. A technician carefully and gradually increases the electrical current until you feel a light tingling sensation. The therapy lasts about 30 minutes and requires several sessions each week. How iontophoresis works is not exactly known. It is thought that the process somehow plugs the sweat glands and temporarily prevents you from sweating. Iontophoresis units are also available for home use. Why the Procedure is Performed 
 
 Iontophoresis may be used to treat excessive sweating ( hyperhidrosis ) of the hands, underarms, and feet. Risks 
 
 Side effects are rare, but may include skin irritation, dryness and blistering. References
