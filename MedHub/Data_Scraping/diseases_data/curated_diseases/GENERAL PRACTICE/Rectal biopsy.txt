 A rectal biopsy is a procedure to remove a small piece of tissue from the rectum for examination. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A rectal biopsy is usually part of  anoscopy  or  sigmoidoscopy .Â These are procedures to view inside the rectum. A  digital rectal exam  is done first. Then, a lubricated instrument (anoscope or proctoscope) is placed into the rectum. You will feel some discomfort when this is done. A  biopsy  can be taken through any of these instruments. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 You may get a laxative, enema, or other preparation before the biopsy so that you can completely empty your bowel. This will allow the doctor a clear view of the rectum. How the Test will Feel
