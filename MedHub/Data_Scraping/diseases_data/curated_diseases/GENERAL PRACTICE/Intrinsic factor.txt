 Intrinsic factor is a protein that helps your intestines absorb vitamin B12. It is made by cells in the stomach lining.  Information 
 
 Intrinsic factor is a protein that helps your body absorb vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is needed for red blood cells to form and grow.  Some people do not make enough intrinsic factor or have a condition that destroys it. If your body does not make enough intrinsic factor, you can develop a type of vitamin B12 deficiency called  pernicious anemia . Surgical removal of the stomach and certain other health conditions can also cause you to stop making intrinsic factor.  References
