 This test may be done to help determine the cause of a high uric acid level in the blood. It may also be done to monitor people with gout, and to choose the best medicine to lower the uric acid level in the blood. Uric acid is a chemical created when the body breaks down substances called purines. Most uric acid dissolves in blood and travels to the kidneys, where it passes out in urine. If your body produces too much uric acid or does not remove enough of it, you may get sick. A high level of uric acid in the body is called hyperuricemia and it can lead to gout or kidney damage. This test may also be done to check whether a high uric acid level is causing kidney stones. Normal Results 
 
 Normal values range from 250 to 750 milligrams per 24 hours (1.48 to 4.43 millimoles per 24 hours). Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 A high uric acid level in the urine may be due to: Body not being able to process purine ( Lesch-Nyhan  syndrome) Certain cancers that have spread (metastasized) Disease that results in breakdown of muscle fibers ( rhabdomyolysis ) Disorders that affect the bone marrow (myeloproliferative disorder) Fanconi syndrome Gout High-purine diet  A low uric acid level in the urine may be due to: Kidney that is not able to get rid of uric acid well, which can lead to gout or kidney damage Kidneys that are not able to filter fluids and waste normally (chronic  glomerulonephritis ) Lead poisoning Long-term (chronic) alcohol use  Risks
