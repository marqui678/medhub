 Gas is air in the intestine that is passed through the rectum. Air that moves from the digestive tract through the mouth is called  belching . Gas is also called flatus or flatulence. Considerations 
 
 Gas is normally formed in the intestines as your body digests food.  Gas can make you feel bloated. It can cause crampy or colicky pains in your belly.  Causes 
 
 Gas can be caused by certain foods you eat. You may have gas if you: Eat foods that are hard to digest, such as fiber. Sometimes, adding more fiber into your diet can cause temporary gas. Your body may adjust and stop producing gas over time. Eat or drink something your body cannot tolerate. For example, some people have  lactose intolerance  and cannot eat or drink dairy products.  Other common causes of gas are: Antibiotics Irritable bowel syndrome Inability to absorb nutrients properly ( malabsorption ) Inability to digest nutrients properly (maldigestion) Swallowing air while eating  Home Care 
 
 The following tips may help you prevent gas: Chew your food more thoroughly. Do not eat beans or cabbage. Avoid foods high in poorly digestible carbohydrates. These are called FODMAPs and include fructose (fruit sugar). Avoid lactose. Do not drink carbonated drinks. Do not chew gum. Eat more slowly. Relax while you eat. Walk for 10 to 15 minutes after eating.  When to Contact a Medical Professional
