 A color vision test checks your ability to distinguish between different colors. How the Test is Performed 
 
 You will sit in a comfortable position in regular lighting. The health care provider will explain the test to you.  You will be shown several cards with colored dot patterns. These cards are called Ishihara plates. In the patterns, some of the dots will appear to form numbers or symbols. You will be asked to identify the symbols, if possible. As you cover one eye, the tester will hold the test cards 14 inches (35 centimeters) from your face and ask you to quickly identify the symbol found in each color pattern. Depending on the problem suspected, you may be asked to determine the intensity of a color, especially in one eye compared to the other. This is often tested by using the cap of a red eyedrop bottle. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 If your child is having this test performed, it may be helpful to explain how the test will feel, and to practice or demonstrate on a doll. Your child will feel less anxious about the test if you explain what will happen and why. Usually there is a sample card of multicolored dots that almost everyone can identify, even people with color vision problems. If you or your child normally wears glasses, wear them during the test. Small children may be asked to tell the difference between a red bottle cap and caps of a different color. How the Test will Feel 
 
 The test is similar to a vision test. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is done to determine whether you have any problems with your color vision. Color vision problems usually fall into two categories: Present from birth (congenital) problems in the light-sensitive cells (cones) of the  retina  (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) -- the color cards are used in this case Diseases of the optic nerve (the nerve that carries visual information from the eye to the brain) -- the bottle caps are used in this case Normal Results 
 
 Normally, you will be able to distinguish all colors. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 This test can determine the following congenital (present from birth)Â color vision problems: Achromatopsia -- complete  color blindness , seeing only shades of gray Deuteranopia -- difficulty telling the difference between red/purple and green/purple Protanopia -- difficulty telling the difference between blue/green and red/green Tritanopia -- difficulty telling the difference between yellow/green and blue/green  Problems in the optic nerve can show up as a loss of color intensity, although the color card test may be normal. Risks 
 
 There are no risks with this test. Alternative Names
