 The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine. It is located between the stomach and the middle part of the small intestine, or jejunum. After foods mix with  stomach acid , they move into the duodenum, where they mix with  bile  from the gallbladder and digestive juices from the pancreas. The absorption of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients begins in the duodenum. Images
