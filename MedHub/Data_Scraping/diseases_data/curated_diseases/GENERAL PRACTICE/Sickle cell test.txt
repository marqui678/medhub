 The sickle cell test looks for the abnormal  hemoglobin  in the blood that causes the disease  sickle cell anemia . How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed.  How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is done to tell if a person has abnormal hemoglobin that causes sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. In sickle cell disease, a person has two abnormal hemoglobin S genes. A person with sickle cell trait has only one of these abnormal genes and no symptoms, or only mild ones. This test does not tell the difference between these two conditions. Another test, called  hemoglobin electrophoresis , will be done to tell which condition someone has. Normal Results 
 
 A normal test result is called a negative result. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 An abnormal test result indicates the person might have one of these: Sickle cell anemia Sickle cell trait  Iron deficiency or blood transfusions within the past 3 months can cause a "false negative" result. This means the person might have the abnormal hemoglobin for sickle cell, but these other factors are making their test results appear negative (normal). Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names
