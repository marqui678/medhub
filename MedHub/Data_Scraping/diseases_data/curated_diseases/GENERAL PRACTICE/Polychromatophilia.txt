 Polychromatophilia refers to how blood cells look under a microscope when the cells are stained with special dyes. It means there is more staining with certain dyes than normal. The extra staining is due to too many immature red blood cells (RBCs) called reticulocytes. These cells have a blue-colored center. Too many reticulocytes are the result of the bone marrow making more red blood cells than normal. This can be caused by certain conditions, such as  hemolytic anemia .  Alternative Names
