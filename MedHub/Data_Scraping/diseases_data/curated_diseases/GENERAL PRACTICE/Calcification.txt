 Calcification is a process in which calcium builds up in body tissue, causing the tissue to harden. This can be a normal or abnormal process. Information 
 
 Ninety-nine percent of calcium entering the body is deposited in bones and teeth. The remaining calcium dissolves in the blood. When a disorder affects the balance between calcium and certain chemicals in the body, calcium can be deposited in other parts of the body, such as the arteries, kidneys, lungs, and brain. Calcium deposits can cause problems with how these blood vessels and organs work. Calcifications can usually be seen on  x-rays . A common example is calcium depositing in the arteries as part of atherosclerosis. Images
