 The parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-RP) test measures the level of a hormone in the blood, called parathyroid hormone-related protein. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample is needed . How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 No special preparation is necessary. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is done to find out whether a  high blood calcium level  is caused by an increase in PTH-related protein. Normal Results 
 
 No detectable (or minimal) PTH-like protein is normal. Women who are breastfeeding may have detectable PTH-related protein values.  Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 An increased level of PTH-related protein with a high blood calcium level is usually caused by cancer. PTH-related protein can be produced by many different kinds of cancers, including those of the lung, breast, head, neck, bladder, and ovaries. A high level of PTH-related protein is the cause of a high calcium level in about two-thirds of cancer patients. This condition is called humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM). Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Alternative Names
