 The gastrin blood test measures the amount of the hormone gastrin in blood. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A blood sample is needed. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Certain medicines may affect the results of this test. Your doctor will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines. Do not stop taking any medicine before talking to your doctor. Medicines that can increase gastrin measurements include antacids, H 2  -blocking agents (such as cimetidine), and proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole).  How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 Gastrin is the main hormone that controls the release of acid in your stomach. When there is food in the stomach, gastrin is released into the blood. As the acid level rises in your stomach and intestines, your body normally makes less gastrin. Your doctor may order this test if you have signs or symptoms of a problem linked to an abnormal amount of gastrin. This includes peptic ulcer disease. Normal Results 
 
 Normal values are generally less than 100 picograms/milliliter (pg/mL) or 48.10 picomoles per liter (pmol/L). Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test result. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Too much gastrin causes severe  peptic ulcer  disease. A higher than normal level may also be due to: Chronic kidney disease Long-term  gastritis Over-activity of the gastrin-producing cells in the stomach (G-cell hyperplasia) Helicobacter pylori  infection of the stomach Use of antacids or medicines to treat heartburn Zollinger-Ellison syndrome , a gastrin-producing  tumor  that may develop in the stomach or pancreas  Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  References
