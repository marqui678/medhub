 Plasma amino acids is a screening test done on infants that looks at the amounts of  amino acids  in the blood. Amino acids are the building blocks for proteins in the body. How the Test is Performed 
 
 Most of the time, blood is  drawn from a vein  located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. In infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin. The blood collects in a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage is put over the spot to stop any bleeding. The blood sample is sent to a lab. There are several types of methods used to determine the individual amino acid levels in the blood. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 The person having the test should not eat 4 hours before the test. How the Test will Feel 
 
 There might be slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn. The needle stick will probably cause an infant or child to cry. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is done to measure the level of amino acids in the blood. An increased level of a particular amino acid is a strong sign that there is a problem with the body's ability to break down (metabolize) that amino acid. The test may also be used to look for decreased levels of amino acids in the blood.  Increased or decreased levels of amino acids in the blood may occur with fevers, inadequate nutrition, and certain medical conditions. Normal Results 
 
 All measurements are in micromole per liter (micro mol/L). Normal values may vary between different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about your specific test results. Alanine  Children: 200 to 450 Adults: 230 to 510 Alpha-aminoadipic acid  Children: not measured Adults: not measured Alpha-amino-N-butyric acid  Children: 8 to 37 Adults: 15 to 41 Arginine  Children: 44 to 120 Adults: 13 to 64 Asparagine  Children: 15 to 40 Adults: 45 to 130 Aspartic acid Children: 0 to 26 Adults: 0 to 6 Beta-alanine  Children: 0 to 49 Adults: 0 to 29 Beta-amino-isobutyric acid  Children: not measured Adults: not measured Carnosine  Children: not measured Adults: not measured Citrulline  Children: 16 to 32 Adults: 16 to 55 Cystine  Children: 19 to 47 Adults: 30 to 65 Glutamic acid  Children: 32 to 140 Adults: 18 to 98 Glutamine  Children: 420 to 730 Adults: 390 to 650 Glycine  Children: 110 to 240 Adults: 170 to 330 Histidine  Children: 68 to 120 Adults: 26 to 120 Hydroxyproline  Children: 0 to 5 Adults: not measured Isoleucine  Children: 37 to 140 Adults: 42 to 100 Leucine  Children: 70 to 170 Adults: 66 to 170 Lysine  Children: 120 to 290 Adults: 150 to 220 Methionine  Children: 13 to 30 Adults: 16 to 30 1-methylhistidine  Children: not measured Adults: not measured 3-methylhistidine  Children: 0 to 52 Adults: 0 to 64 Ornithine  Children: 44 to 90 Adults: 27 to 80 Phenylalanine Children: 26 to 86 Adults: 41 to 68 Phosphoserine  Children: 0 to 12 Adults: 0 to 12 Phosphoethanolamine  Children: 0 to 12 Adults: 0 to 55 Proline  Children: 130 to 290 Adults: 110 to 360 Serine  Children: 93 to 150 Adults: 56 to 140 Taurine  Children: 11 to 120 Adults: 45 to 130 Threonine  Children: 67 to 150 Adults: 92 to 240 Tyrosine  Children: 26 to 110 Adults: 45 to 74 Valine  Children: 160 to 350 Adults: 150 to 310 The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 An increase in the total level of amino acids in the blood may be due to: Eclampsia Fructose intolerance Ketoacidosis (from diabetes) Kidney failure Reye syndrome Laboratory error  A decrease in the total level of amino acids in the blood may be due to: Adrenal cortical hyperfunction Fever Hartnup disease Huntington's chorea Malnutrition Nephrotic syndrome Phlebotomus fever Rheumatoid arthritis Laboratory error  High or low amounts of individual plasma amino acids must be considered with other information. Abnormal results may be due to diet, hereditary problems, or effects of a medication. Considerations 
 
 Screening infants for increased levels of amino acids can help detect problems with metabolism. Early treatment for these conditions may prevent complications in the future. Alternative Names
