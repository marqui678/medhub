Bone problems may include: Bone deformities Bone infections Bone tumors Fractures Need for amputation Nonunions: failure of fractures to heal Malunions: fractures healing in a wrong position Spinal deformities  Joint problems may include: Arthritis Bursitis Dislocation Joint pain Joint swelling or inflammation Ligament tears  Common orthopedic-related diagnoses based on body part include: ANKLE AND FOOT: Bunions Fasciitis Foot and ankle deformities Fractures Hammer toe Heel pain Heel spurs Joint pain and arthritis Sprains Tarsal tunnel syndrome Sesamoiditis  HAND AND WRIST: Fractures Joint pain Arthritis Tendon or ligament injury Carpal tunnel syndrome Ganglion cyst Tendinitis Tendon tears Infection SHOULDER: Arthritis Bursitis Dislocation Frozen shoulder ( adhesive capsulitis ) Impingement syndrome Loose or foreign bodies Rotator cuff tear Rotator cuff tendinitis Separation Torn labrum SLAP tears  Fractures KNEE: Cartilage and meniscus injuries Dislocation of the kneecap (patella) Ligament sprains or tears (anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate, medial collateral, and lateral collateral ligament tears) Loose or foreign bodies Osgood-Schlatter disease Pain Tendinitis  Fractures ELBOW: Arthritis Bursitis Dislocation or separation Ligament sprains or tears Loose or foreign bodies Pain Tennis  or  golfers  elbow ( epicondylitis  or tendinitis) Elbow stiffness or contractures  Fractures SPINE: Herniated (slipped) disk Infection of the spine Injury to the spine Scoliosis Spinal stenosis Spinal tumor Fractures Spinal cord injuries SERVICES AND TREATMENTS Imaging procedures can help diagnose or even treat many orthopedic conditions. Your health care provider may order: Arthrogram (joint x-ray) Bone scans Computed tomography (CT) scan Discography Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan X-rays  Sometimes, treatment involves injections of medicine into the painful area. This may involve: Corticosteroid injections into joints, tendons, and ligaments, and around the spine Hyaluronic acid injection to help relieve arthritis pain  Surgical procedures used in the treatment of orthopedics include: Amputation Arthroscopic  surgeries Bunionectomy and hammer toe repair Cartilage repair or resurfacing procedures Cartilage surgery to knee Fracture care Arthroplasty Ligament reconstructions Repair of torn ligaments and tendons Spine surgery, including diskectomy, foraminotomy, laminectomy, and spinal fusion  Newer orthopedic services procedures include: Minimally invasive surgery Advanced external fixation Use of bone graft substitutes and bone-fusing protein WHO IS INVOLVED Orthopedic care often involves a team approach. Your team may include a doctor, a non-doctor specialist as well as others. Non-doctor specialists are professionals such as a physical therapist. Orthopedic surgeons receive 5 or more extra years of training after school. They specialize in the care of disorders of the bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. They are trained to manage joint problems with both operative and non-operative techniques. Physical medicine and rehabilitation doctors have 4 or more extra years of training after medical school. They specialize in this type of care. They are also referred to as physiatrists. They do not perform surgery, although they can give joint injections. Sports medicine physicians are doctors with experience in sports medicine. They have a primary specialty in family practice, internal medicine, emergency medicine, pediatrics, or physical medicine and rehabilitation. Most have 1 to 2 years of additional training in sports medicine through subspecialty programs in sports medicine. Sports medicine is a special branch of orthopedics. This provides complete medical care to active people of all ages.  Other doctors that may be a part of the orthopedics team include: Neurologists Pain specialists Primary care doctors Psychiatrists  Chiropractors Non-doctor health professionals that may be a part of the orthopedics team include: Athletic trainers Counselors Nurse practitioners Physical therapists Physician assistants Psychologists Social workers Vocational workers  References
