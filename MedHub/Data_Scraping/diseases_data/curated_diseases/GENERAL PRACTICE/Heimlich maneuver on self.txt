 If you are choking on something, you can perform the Heimlich maneuver on yourself. Follow these steps: Make a fist with one hand. Place your thumb of this hand below your rib cage and above your navel. Grasp your fist with your other hand. Press your fist into the area with a quick upward movement. You can also lean over a table edge, chair, or railing. Quickly thrust your upper belly area (upper abdomen) against the edge. If you need to, you should repeat this motion until the object blocking your airway comes out. See also:  Choking first aid Images
