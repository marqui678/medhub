 The serotonin test measures the level of serotonin in the blood.  How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 No special preparation is needed. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel slight pain. Others feel a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 Serotonin is a chemical produced by nerve cells. This test may be done to diagnose  carcinoid syndrome . Carcinoid syndrome is a group of symptoms associated with carcinoid tumors. These are tumors of the small intestine, colon, appendix, and bronchial tubes in the lungs. People with carcinoid syndrome often have high levels of serotonin in the blood. Normal Results 
 
 The normal range is 101 to 283 ng/mL. Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 A higher-than-normal level may indicate carcinoid syndrome. Risks 
 
 There is very little risk in having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Alternative Names 
 
 5-HT level; 5-hydroxytryptamine level; Serotonin test Images
