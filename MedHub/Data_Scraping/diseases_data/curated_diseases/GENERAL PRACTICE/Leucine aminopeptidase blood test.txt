 The leucine aminopeptidase test measures how much of this  enzyme  is in your blood. Your urine can also be checked for this  substance . How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed.  How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 The health care provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking certain medicines that can affect the test. Drugs that can increase albumin levels include estrogen and progesterone. Do not stop taking any of your medicines without talking to your provider first. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 Leucine aminopeptidase is a type of protein called an  enzyme . This enzyme is normally found in cells of the liver and small intestine. Your provider may order this test to check if your liver is damaged. Too much leucine aminopeptidase is released into your blood when you have a liver tumor or damage to your liver cells. This test is not done very often. Other tests, such as  gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase , are as accurate and easier to get. Normal Results 
 
 Normal range is: Male: 80 to 200 U/mL Female: 75 to 185 U/mL Normal value ranges may vary slightly. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.  What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 An abnormal result may be a sign of: Bile flow from the liver is blocked ( cholestasis ) Cirrhosis Hepatitis Liver cancer Liver ischemia (reduced blood flow to the liver) Liver  necrosis  (death of liver tissue) Liver tumor Use of drugs that are toxic to the liver  Risks 
 
 There is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Alternative Names
