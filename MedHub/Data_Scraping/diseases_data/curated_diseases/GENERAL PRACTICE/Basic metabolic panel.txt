 You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is done to evaluate: Kidney function Blood acid/base balance Blood sugar levels In some cases, the test also is used to check blood levels of calcium and a protein called albumin. Normal Results 
 
 The following are normal ranges for the blood chemicals tested: BUN : 7 to 20 mg/dL (2.50 to 7.14 mmol/L) CO2 (carbon dioxide) : 20 to 29 mmol/L Creatinine : 0.8 to 1.2 mg/dL (70.72 to 106.08 micromol/L) Glucose : 64 to 100 mg/dL (3.55 to 5.55 mmol/L) Serum chloride : 101 to 111 mmol/L Serum potassium : 3.7 to 5.2 mEq/L (3.7 to 5.2 mmol/L) Serum sodium : 136 to 144 mEq/L (136 to 144 mmol/L) Key to abbreviations: L = liter dL = deciliter = 0.1 liter mg = milligram mmol = millimole mEq = milliequivalents  Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results. The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Abnormal results can be due to a variety of different medical conditions, including kidney failure, breathing problems, diabetes or diabetes-related complications, and medication side effects.
