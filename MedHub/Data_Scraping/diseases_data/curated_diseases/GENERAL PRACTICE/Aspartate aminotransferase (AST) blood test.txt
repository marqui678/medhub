 The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) blood test measures the level of the  enzyme  AST in the blood. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed.  How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 No special preparation is needed. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 AST is an enzyme found in high levels in the liver, heart, and muscles. It is also found in lesser amounts in other tissues. An enzyme is a protein that causes a specific chemical change in the body. This test is mainly done along with other tests (such as  ALT ,  ALP , and  bilirubin ) to diagnose and monitor  liver disease . Normal Results 
 
 The normal range is 10 to 34 U/L. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 An increased AST level is usually a sign of liver disease. Liver disease is even more likely when the levels of substances checked by other liver blood tests have also increased.  An increased AST level may be due to any of the following: Scarring of the liver ( cirrhosis )  Death of liver tissue Heart attack Too much iron in the body ( hemochromatosis ) Swollen and inflamed liver ( hepatitis ) Lack of blood flow to the liver (liver ischemia) Liver cancer or tumor Use of drugs that are toxic to the liver Mononucleosis  ("mono") Muscle disease or trauma Swollen and inflamed pancreas ( pancreatitis )  AST level may also increase after: Burns (deep) Heart procedures Seizure Surgery Pregnancy and exercise may also cause an increased AST level. Risks 
 
 Veins vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: 
Bleeding from where the needle was inserted
  Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood collecting under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Alternative Names 
 
 Aspartate aminotransferase; Serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase; SGOT References
