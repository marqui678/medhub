 Empyema is a collection of pus in the space between the lung and the inner surface of the chest wall (pleural space). Causes 
 
 Empyema is usually caused by an infection that spreads from the lung. It leads to a buildup of pus in the pleural space. There can be a pint (1/2 liter) or more of infected fluid. This fluid puts pressure on the lungs. Risk factors include: Bacterial pneumonia Tuberculosis Chest surgery Lung abscess Trauma or injury to the chest  In rare cases, empyema can occur after  thoracentesis . This is a procedure in which a needle is inserted through the chest wall to draw off fluid in the pleural space for medical diagnosis or treatment. Symptoms 
 
 Symptoms of empyema may include any of the following: Chest pain , which worsens when you breathe in deeply (pleurisy) Dry  cough Excessive sweating , especially night sweats Fever  and chills General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling ( malaise ) Shortness of breath Weight loss  (unintentional)  Exams and Tests 
 
 The health care provider may note decreased breath sounds or an abnormal sound (friction rub) when listening to the chest with a stethoscope ( auscultation ). Tests that may be ordered include: Chest x-ray CT scan  of chest Pleural fluid analysis Â  Thoracentesis Treatment 
 
 The goal of treatment is to cure the infection. This involves the following: Placing a tube in your chest to drain the pus Giving you antibiotics to control the infection If you have problems breathing, you may need surgery to help your lung expand properly. Outlook (Prognosis) 
 
 When empyema complicates pneumonia, the risk of permanent lung damage and death goes up. Long-term treatment with antibiotics and drainage are needed.  In general, most people fully recover from empyema. Possible Complications 
 
 Having empyema may lead to the following: Pleural thickening Reduced lung function When to Contact a Medical Professional
