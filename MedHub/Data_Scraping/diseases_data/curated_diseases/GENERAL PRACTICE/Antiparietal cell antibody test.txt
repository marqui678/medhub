 An antiparietal cell antibody test is a blood test that looks for  antibodies  against the parietal cells of the stomach. The parietal cells make and release a substance that the body needs to absorb vitamin B12. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 No special preparation is necessary. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 Your health care provider may use this test to help diagnose pernicious anemia.  Pernicious anemia  is a decrease in red blood cells that occurs when your intestines cannot properly absorb vitamin B12. Other tests are also used to help with the diagnosis. Normal Results 
 
 A normal result is called a negative result. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 An abnormal result is called a positive result. This may be due to: Atrophic  gastritis  (inflammation of the stomach lining) Diabetes Gastric ulcer Pernicious anemia Thyroid disease  Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: 
 Excessive bleeding
  
 Fainting or feeling lightheaded
  
 Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin)
  
 Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
