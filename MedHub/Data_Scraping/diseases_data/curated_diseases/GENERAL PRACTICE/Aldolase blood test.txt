 Aldolase is a protein (called an enzyme) that helps break down certain sugars to produce energy. It is found in high amount in muscle tissue. A test can be done to measure the amount of aldolase in your blood. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 You may be told not to eat or drink anything for 6 hours before the test. Your health care provider will tell you if it is necessary to stop taking any medicines that may interfere with this test. Tell your provider about all the medicines you are taking, both prescription and nonprescription. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is done to diagnose or monitor muscle or liver damage. Other tests that may be ordered to check for liver damage include: ALT (alanine aminotransferase) test AST (aspartate aminotransferase) test Other tests that may be ordered to check for muscle cell damage include: CPK (creatine phosphokinase) test LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) test Normal Results 
 
 Normal results range between 1.0 to 7.5 units per liter (0.02 to 0.13 microkat/L). There is a slight difference between men and women. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 A higher than normal level may be due to: Damage to skeletal muscles Heart attack Liver, pancreatic, or prostate cancer Muscle disease such as  dermatomyositis ,  muscular dystrophy ,  polymyositis Swelling and inflammation of the liver ( hepatitis ) Viral infection called  mononucleosis Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Images
