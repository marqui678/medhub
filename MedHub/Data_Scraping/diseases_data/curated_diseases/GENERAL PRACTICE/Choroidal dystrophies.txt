 Choroidal dystrophy is an eye disorder that involves a layer of blood vessels called the  choroid . These vessels are between the  sclera  and  retina .  In most cases, choroidal dystrophy is due to an abnormal gene, which is passed down through families. It most often affects males, starting in childhood. The first symptoms are peripheral vision loss and vision loss at night. An eye surgeon who specializes in the retina (back of the eye) can diagnose this disorder.  Exams and Tests
