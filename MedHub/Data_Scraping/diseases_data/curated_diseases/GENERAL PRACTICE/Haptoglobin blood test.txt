 The haptoglobin blood test measures the level of haptoglobin in your blood.  Haptoglobin is a protein produced by the liver. It attaches to a certain type of  hemoglobin  in the blood. Hemoglobin is a blood cell that carries oxygen. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Certain medicines may affect the results of this test. Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines. DO NOT stop any medicine before talking to your provider. Drugs that can raise haptoglobin levels include: Androgens Corticosteroids  Drugs that can lower haptoglobin levels include: Birth control pills Chlorpromazine Diphenhydramine Indomethacin Isoniazid Nitrofurantoin Quinidine Streptomycin  How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is done to see how fast your red blood cells are destroyed. It may be done if your provider suspects you have a type of anemia that your immune system is causing. Normal Results 
 
 The normal range is 41 to 165 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 410 to 1650 milligrams per liter (mg/L). Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 When red blood cells are actively being destroyed, haptoglobin disappears faster than it is created. As a result, the levels of haptoglobin in the blood drop. Lower than normal levels may be due to: Immune hemolytic anemia Chronic liver disease Blood buildup under the skin (hematoma) Liver disease Transfusion reaction  Higher-than-normal levels may be due to: Blockage of the bile ducts Joint or muscle inflammation, swelling, and pain that comes on suddenly Peptic ulcer Ulcerative colitis Other inflammatory conditions  Risks 
 
 There is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) References
