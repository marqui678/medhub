 A secondary infection is an infection that occurs during or after treatment for another infection. It may be caused by the first treatment or by changes in the immune system. Two examples of a secondary infection are: Getting a vaginal yeast infection after taking antibiotics to treat an infection caused by bacteria Developing pneumonia caused by bacteria after having an upper respiratory infection (like a cold) that was caused by a virus Images
