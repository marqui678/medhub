 Traction means pulling on part of the body. Most often, traction uses devices such as weights and pulleys to put tension on a displaced bone or joint, such as a dislocated shoulder. The tension helps put the joint back in position and keep it still. Traction is also used to keep a group of muscles (such as the neck muscles) stretched to reduce  muscle spasms . This is called cervical traction. Information 
 
 A traction treatment will involve a:  Certain amount of tension to pull the body part into another position Length of time to use the tension Way to keep the tension steady References
