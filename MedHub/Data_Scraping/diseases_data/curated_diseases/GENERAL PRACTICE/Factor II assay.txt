 The factor II assay is a blood test to measure the activity of factor II. Factor II is also known as prothrombin. This is one of the proteins in the body that helps the blood clot. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 No special preparation is needed. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is used to find the cause of too much bleeding (decreased blood clotting). This decreased clotting may be caused by an abnormally low level of factor II. Normal Results 
 
 The value should be 50 to 200% of the laboratory control or reference value. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Decreased factor II activity may be the result of: Deficiency of factor II Disorder in which the proteins that control blood clotting become over active ( disseminated intravascular coagulation ) Fat  malabsorption  (not enough fat absorbed in the diet) Liver disease  (such as  cirrhosis ) Vitamin K  deficiency Taking the blood thinning drug called warfarin (Coumadin) Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size so it may be harder to take a blood sample from one person than another. Other slight risks associated with having blood drawn may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling light headed Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  This test is most often performed on people who have bleeding problems. The risk of excessive bleeding is slightly greater than for people without bleeding problems. Alternative Names
