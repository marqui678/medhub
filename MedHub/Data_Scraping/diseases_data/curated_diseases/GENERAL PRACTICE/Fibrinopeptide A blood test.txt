 Fibrinopeptide A is a substance released as blood clots in your body. A test can be done to measure the level of this substance in your blood.  How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 No special preparation is necessary. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is used to help diagnose severe problems with blood clotting such as disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC ). Certain types of leukemia are associated with DIC. Normal Results 
 
 In general, the level of fibrinopeptide A should range from 0.6 to 1.9 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 An increased fibrinopeptide A level may be a sign of: Cellulitis DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation)  Leukemia at the time of diagnosis, during early treatment, and during a relapse Some infections Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Alternative Names
