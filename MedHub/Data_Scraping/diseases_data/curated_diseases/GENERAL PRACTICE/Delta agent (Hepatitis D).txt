 Delta agent is a type of virus called hepatitis D. It causes symptoms only in people who also have  hepatitis B  infection. Causes 
 
 Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is found only in people who carry the hepatitis B virus. HDV may make liver disease worse in people who have either recent (acute) or long-term (chronic) hepatitis B. It can even cause symptoms in people who carry  hepatitis B  virus but who never had symptoms. Hepatitis D infects about 15 million people worldwide. It occurs in a small number of people who carry hepatitis B. Risk factors include: Abusing intravenous (IV) or injection drugs Being infected while pregnant (the mother can pass the virus to the baby) Carrying the hepatitis B virus Men having sexual intercourse with other men Receiving many blood transfusions  Symptoms 
 
 Hepatitis D may make the symptoms of hepatitis B worse. Symptoms may include: Abdominal pain Dark-colored urine Fatigue Jaundice Joint pain Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting  Exams and Tests 
 
 You may need the following tests: Anti-delta agent antibody Liver biopsy Liver enzymes (blood test)  Treatment 
 
 Many of the medicines used to treat  hepatitis B  are not helpful for treating hepatitis D. You may receive a medicine called alpha interferon for up to 12 months if you have a long-term HDV infection. A liver transplant for end-stage chronic hepatitis B may be effective. Outlook (Prognosis) 
 
 People with an  acute  HDV infection most often get better over 2 to 3 weeks. Liver enzyme levels return to normal within 16 weeks. About 1 in 10 of those who are infected may develop long-term (chronic) liver inflammation (hepatitis). Possible Complications 
 
 Complications may include: Chronic active hepatitis Fulminant hepatitis  When to Contact a Medical Professional 
 
 Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of hepatitis B. Prevention 
 
 Steps to prevent the condition include: Detect and treat hepatitis B infection as soon as possible to help prevent hepatitis D. Avoid intravenous drug (IV) abuse. If you use IV drugs, avoid sharing needles. Get vaccinated against hepatitis B. Adults who are at high risk for hepatitis B infection and all children should get this vaccine. If you do not get Hepatitis B, you cannot get Hepatitis D. Alternative Names
