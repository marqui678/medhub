 Thyroid function tests are used to tell whether your thyroid is working normally. The most common thyroid function tests are: Total, or free  T4  (the main thyroid hormone in your blood) TSH  (the hormone from the pituitary gland that stimulates the thyroid to produce T4) T3  (the active form of the hormone -- T4 is converted to T3)  Other thyroid tests include: T3 resin uptake  (an older test that is rarely used now) Thyroid uptake and  scan Thyroid binding globulin Thyroglobulin  Images
