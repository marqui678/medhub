 The ceruloplasmin test measures the level of the copper-containing protein ceruloplasmin in the blood.  How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed.  How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 No special preparation is needed. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 Ceruloplasmin is made in the liver. Ceruloplasmin stores and transports copper in the blood to parts of the body that need it. Your health care provider may order this test if you have signs or symptoms of a copper  metabolism  or copper storage disorder. Normal Results 
 
 Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 Lower-than-normal ceruloplasmin levels may be due to: Long-term liver disease Problem absorbing nutrients from food ( intestinal malabsorption ) Malnutrition Disorder in which cells in the body can absorb copper, but are unable to release it ( Menkes syndrome ) Group of disorders that damage the kidneys ( nephrotic syndrome ) Inherited disorder in which there is too much copper in the body's tissues ( Wilson disease ) Higher-than-normal ceruloplasmin levels may be due to: Acute  and  chronic  infections Lymphoma Pregnancy Rheumatoid arthritis Use of birth control pills Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  References
