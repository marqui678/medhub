 The myoglobin blood test measures the level of the protein myoglobin in the blood. Myoglobin  can also be measured with a urine test. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  blood sample  is needed.  How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 No special preparation is needed. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 Myoglobin is a protein in heart and skeletal muscles. When you exercise, your muscles use up available oxygen. Myoglobin has oxygen attached to it, which provides extra oxygen for the muscles to keep at a high level of activity for a longer period. When muscle is damaged, myoglobin in muscle cells is released into the bloodstream. The kidneys help remove myoglobin from the blood into the urine. When the level of myoglobin is too high, it can damage the kidneys. This test is ordered when your health care provider suspects you have muscle damage, such as of the heart or skeletal muscle. Normal Results 
 
 The normal range is 0 to 85 ng/mL. Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 An increased level of myoglobin may be due to: Heart attack Malignant hyperthermia  (very rare) Muscular dystrophy Breakdown of muscle tissue that leads to the release of muscle fiber contents into the blood ( rhabdomyolysis ) Skeletal muscle inflammation ( myositis ) Skeletal muscle ischemia (oxygen deficiency) Skeletal muscle trauma Risks 
 
 There is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  Alternative Names
