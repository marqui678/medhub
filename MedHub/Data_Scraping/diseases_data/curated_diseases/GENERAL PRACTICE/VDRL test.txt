 The VDRL test is a screening test for syphilis. It measures substances (proteins), called antibodies, that your body may produce if you have come in contact with the bacteria that cause syphilis. How the Test is Performed 
 
 The test is most often done using a blood sample. It can also be done using a sample of spinal fluid. This article discusses the blood test. A  blood sample  is needed. How the Test will Feel 
 
 When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people may feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 This test is used to screen for  syphilis . The bacteria that cause syphilis is called  Treponema pallidum. Your health care provider may order this test if you have signs and symptoms of a sexually transmitted illness (STI). Syphilis screening is a routine part of prenatal care during pregnancy. Several states also require screening for syphilis prior to obtaining a marriage license. This test is similar to the newer rapid plasma reagin ( RPR ) test. Normal Results 
 
 A negative test is normal. It means that no antibodies to syphilis have been seen in your blood sample. The screening test is most likely to be positive in the secondary and latent stages of syphilis. This test may give a false-negative result during early- and late-stage syphilis. This test must be confirmed with another blood test to make the diagnosis of syphilis. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 A positive test result may mean you have syphilis. If the test is positive, the next step is to confirm the results with an  FTA-ABS  test, which is a more specific syphilis test. The VDRL test's ability to detect syphilis depends on the stage of the disease. The test's sensitivity to detect syphilis nears 100% during the middle stages; it is less sensitive during the earlier and later stages. Some conditions may cause a false-positive test, including: HIV Lyme disease Certain types of pneumonia Malaria Systemic lupus erythematosus The body does not always produce antibodies specifically in response to the syphilis bacteria, so this test is not always accurate. Risks 
 
 Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names
