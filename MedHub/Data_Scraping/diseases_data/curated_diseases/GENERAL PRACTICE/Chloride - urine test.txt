 The urine chloride test measures the amount of chloride in a certain volume of urine. How the Test is Performed 
 
 After you provide a urine sample, it is tested in the lab. If needed, the health care provider may ask you to  collect your urine at home over a period of 24 hours . Your provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Your provider will ask you to temporarily stop taking any medicines that may affect the test result. Tell your provider about all the medicines you take, including: Acetazolamide Corticosteroids Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Water pills (diuretic medicines)  DO NOT stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.

 The normal range is 110 to 250 mEq/L per day. This range depends on the amount of salt and fluid you take in. The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test result. What Abnormal Results Mean
