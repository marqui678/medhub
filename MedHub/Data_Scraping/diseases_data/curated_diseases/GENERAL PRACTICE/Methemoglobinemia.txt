 Methemoglobinemia (MetHb) is a blood disorder in which an abnormal amount of methemoglobin is produced. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells (RBCs) that carries and distributes oxygen to the body. Methemoglobin is a form of hemoglobin. With methemoglobinemia, the hemoglobin can carry oxygen, but is not able to release it effectively to body tissues. Causes 
 
 MetHb condition can be: Passed down through families (inherited or congenital) Caused by exposure to certain drugs, chemicals, or foods (acquired) There are two forms of inherited MetHb. The first form is passed on by both parents. The parents usually do not have the condition themselves. They carry the gene that causes the condition. It occurs when there is a problem with an enzyme called  cytochrome b5 reductase . There are two types of inherited MetHb: 
 Type 1 (also called erythrocyte reductase deficiency) occurs when RBCs lack the enzyme.
  
 Type 2 (also called generalized reductase deficiency) occurs when the enzyme doesn't work in the body.
  The second form of inherited MetHb is called hemoglobin M disease. It is caused by defects in the hemoglobin protein itself. Only one parent needs to pass on the abnormal gene for the child to inherit the disease. Acquired MetHb  is more common than the inherited forms. It occurs in some people after they are exposed to certain chemicals and drugs, including: 
 Anesthetics such as benzocaine
  Nitrobenzene 
 Certain antibiotics (including dapsone and chloroquine)
  
 Nitrites (used as additives to prevent meat from spoiling)
  Certain foods, such as spinach, beets or carrots contain natural nitrates in large amounts. These foods should not be given to children younger than 6 months of age. Symptoms 
 
 Symptoms of type 1 MetHb include: 
   Bluish coloring of the skin
    Symptoms of type 2 MetHb include: 
   Developmental delay
    
   Failure to thrive
    
   Intellectual disability
    Seizures Symptoms of hemoglobin M disease include: 
   Bluish coloring of the skin
    Symptoms of acquired MetHb include: 
   Bluish coloring of the skin
    Headache 
   Fatigue
    
  Shortness of breath
    
   Lack of energy
    Exams and Tests 
 
 A baby with this condition will have a bluish skin color (cyanosis) at birth or shortly afterward. The health care provider will perform blood tests to diagnose the condition. Tests may include: Checking the oxygen level in the blood (pulse oximetry) Blood test to check levels of gases in the blood ( arterial blood gas analysis ) Treatment 
 
 People with hemoglobin M disease don't have symptoms. So, they may not need treatment. A medicine called methylene blue is used to treat severe MetHb. Methylene blue may be unsafe in people who have or may be at risk for a blood disease called  G6PD deficiency . They should not take this medicine. If you or your child has G6PD deficiency, always tell your provider before getting treatment. Ascorbic acid  may also be used to reduce the level of methemoglobin. Alternative treatments include  hyperbaric oxygen therapy , red blood cell transfusion and  exchange transfusions . In most cases of mild acquired MetHb, no treatment is needed. But you should avoid the medicine or chemical that caused the problem. Severe cases may need a blood transfusion. Outlook (Prognosis) 
 
 People with type 1 MetHb and hemoglobin M disease often do well. Type 2 MetHb is more serious. It often causes death within the first few years of life. People with acquired MetHb often do very well once the drug, food, or chemical that caused the problem is identified and avoided. Possible Complications 
 
 Complications of MetHb include: Shock Seizures Death When to Contact a Medical Professional 
 
 Call your health care provider if you: Have a family history of MetHb Develop symptoms of this disorder Call your provider or emergency services (911) right away if you have severe  shortness of breath . Prevention 
 
 Genetic counseling is suggested for couples with a family history of MetHb and are considering having children. Alternative Names 
 
 Hemoglobin M disease; Erythrocyte reductase deficiency; Generalized reductase deficiency; MetHb Images
