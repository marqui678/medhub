 A Dacron graft is made out of a man-made (synthetic) polyester material. It is used to replace natural body tissues. Most Dacron grafts are in the shape of a tube to replace or repair blood vessels. A Dacron graft can be used as a  stent  to repair an artery, blood vessel, or other hollow structure in your body (such as the tube that carries urine) to hold it open. The graft causes very few reactions. It has no harmful chemicals and is easy for our bodies to tolerate. When it is used in blood vessels, our bodies grow a new lining to the graft over time that is like our natural blood vessel linings. Improvements to Dacron grafts have reduced the risk of graft infection, but infections can still occur. Images
