Vasoconstriction may be slight or severe. It may result from disease, drugs, or psychological conditions. Medicines that cause vasoconstriction include: Decongestants, including pseudoephedrine Cough and cold combinations Caffeine Medicines may be used to increase or reduce vasoconstriction in very ill people.
