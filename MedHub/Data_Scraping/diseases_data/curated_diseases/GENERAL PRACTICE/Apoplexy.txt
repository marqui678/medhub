 Apoplexy is bleeding into an organ or loss of blood flow to an organ. For example,  Adrenal apoplexy: Bleeding into the  adrenal glands Pituitary apoplexy: Bleeding into the pituitary gland Apoplexy refers to stroke symptoms that occur suddenly. Such symptoms occur due to bleeding into the brain. It can also occur by a blood clot in a brain blood vessel. Conditions such as  subarachnoid hemorrhage  or  stroke  are sometimes called apoplexy. Functional apoplexy is when a person appears to be having stroke-like symptoms. However, there is no brain defect. Images
