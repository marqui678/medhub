 Alveolar abnormalities are changes in the tiny air sacs in the lungs, called alveoli. Alveoli allow oxygen to enter the blood. They are very thin to let oxygen move from the lungs to the blood vessels, and for carbon dioxide to be removed from the blood vessels to the lungs. Depending on the disease, alveoli may: Collapse Fuse together Develop thickened linings Fill with fluid Fill with blood Fill with pus Get destroyed Images
