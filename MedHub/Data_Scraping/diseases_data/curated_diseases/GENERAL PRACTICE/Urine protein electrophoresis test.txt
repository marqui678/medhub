 The urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) test is used to estimate how much of certain proteins are in the urine. How the Test is Performed 
 
 A  clean-catch urine sample  is needed. The clean-catch method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, the health care provider may give you a special clean-catch kit that contains a cleansing solution and sterile wipes. Follow the instructions exactly. After you provide a urine sample, it is sent to the laboratory. There, the laboratory specialist will place the urine sample on special paper and apply an electric current. The proteins move and form visible bands. These reveal the general amounts of each protein. How to Prepare for the Test 
 
 Your provider may tell you to stop taking certain medicines that could interfere with the test. Medicines that can affect test results include: Chlorpromazine Corticosteroids Isoniazid Neomycin Phenacemide Salicylates Sulfonamides Tolbutamide  Do not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider. How the Test will Feel 
 
 This test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort. Why the Test is Performed 
 
 Normally there is no protein, or only a small amount of protein in the urine. An abnormally high amount of protein in the urine can be a sign of many different disorders. UPEP may be recommended to help determine the cause of protein in the urine. Or it may be done as a screening test to measure the various amounts of different types of proteins in urine. UPEP detects 2 types of protein: albumin and globulins. Normal Results 
 
 No significant amount of globulins are found in the urine. Urine albumin is less than 5 mg/dL. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different specimens. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean 
 
 If the urine sample has a significant amount of globulins or higher than normal level of albumin, it may mean any of the following: Acute  inflammation Abnormal protein buildup in tissues and organs ( amyloidosis ) Decreased kidney function 
   Kidney disease due to diabetes ( diabetic nephropathy ) Kidney failure 
   A type of blood cancer called  multiple myeloma 
   Group of symptoms that include protein in the urine, low protein level in the blood, swelling ( nephrotic syndrome ) Acute  urinary tract infection Risks 
 
 There are no risks with this test. Alternative Names 
 
 Urine protein electrophoresis; UPEP; Multiple myeloma - UPEP; Waldenström macroglobulinemia - UPEP; Amyloidosis - UPEP
