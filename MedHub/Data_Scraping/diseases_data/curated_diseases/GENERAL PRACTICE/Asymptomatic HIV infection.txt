 Asymptomatic HIV infection is a phase of  HIV/AIDS  during which there are no symptoms of HIV infection.  During this phase, the immune system in someone with HIV slowly deteriorates, but the person has no symptoms. How long this phase lasts depends on how quickly the HIV virus copies itself, and how the person's genes affect the way the body handles the virus. Some people can go 10 years or longer without symptoms. Others may have symptoms and worsening immune function within a few years after the original infection. Images
